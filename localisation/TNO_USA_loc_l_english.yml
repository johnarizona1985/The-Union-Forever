 #FOCUSES
 USA_OFN_South_Africa:0 "Our Sacred Duty"
 USA_OFN_South_Africa_desc:0 "The Organization of Free Nations was created to aid the last remaining democracies on Earth, and the frail democracy in South Africa needs our help. With a German invasion looming on the horizon, we need to ensure support for the nation so that they do not succumb to the Reich. Time is running out for the final beacon of democracy in Africa."
 USA_OFN_Canada:0 "Rally the Canadians"
 USA_OFN_Canada_desc:0 "Even though Canada is preparing to help the rightful English ruler retake London, they are still committed to the OFN. As such, they are obligated to give us some much-needed assistance in our African war against the Germans. We should call upon our Canadian allies, and who knows, we might be able to give them some money in exchange."
 USA_OFN_your_ancestors:0 "We Fight for Freedom"
 USA_OFN_your_ancestors_desc:0 "We have been looking at ways to best get in touch with the public surrounding the South African War. We must remind our citizens that we, too, fought against oppression in the Revolutionary War that brought us into existence many years ago. Right now, Nazi Germany is looking to destroy the liberties that South Africans hold dear, the very same liberties that we held back in 1776. We fought for freedom, and we promise to help the South Africans fight for their freedom."
 USA_OFN_the_black_hand:0 "Stop the Black Hand of Nazism!"
 USA_OFN_the_black_hand_desc:0 "Africa is a sad place, grasped by the ugly hand of nazism. Engulfed in the dark mess of fascist demagoguery. The people of Africa deserve to decide their own fate. We must liberate Africa, cut of the support to the Nazi Reichskommissariats and free the people there. Africa will be nazi no more!"
 USA_OFN_a_moral_war:0 "A Moral War"
 USA_OFN_a_moral_war_desc:0 "Rally the various churches around our country, many people trust the congregations' judgement, if we can give them the arguments, they will surely talk to the media about the war and tell the American people how it is pious to defend democracy and freedom in other countries."
 USA_OFN_kickstart_media:0 "Kickstart the Media"
 USA_OFN_kickstart_media_desc:0 "Times have changed, and in our new American society, the President does not have as much influence over his people as he would like. We need to get our message out to the media to guarantee public support for the upcoming struggle. Our people need to know that we are defending a weak democracy that currently stands alone against the looming Nazi presence. We will have the newspapers printing propaganda every day if it means we will garner public support."
 USA_OFN_boer_atrocities:0 "Exaggerate Boer Atrocities"
 USA_OFN_boer_atrocities_desc:0 "Overall, it seems like the American public is still adamant in their pacifist beliefs. Even if the war is only a regional conflict, our folks at home are not very happy about another war in foreign land. We have been picking up reports of German crimes being committed in South Africa; if we exaggerate these tales enough, we will be able to get the support we need. We must magnify German cruelty in order to ensure that all Americans strongly oppose the very enemies we are fighting."
 USA_OFN_dominoe_theory:0 "Domino Theory"
 USA_OFN_dominoe_theory_desc:0 "This is not a war to exploit someone else, this is a war for democracy. If we do not step up our game, nation after nation will fall to the nazis. The only way to stop the domino train from toppling us, is to stop it from ever beginning to fall. South Africa is the first piece in a long chain of nations that lead to the US, we cannot let South Africa fall."
 USA_OFN_a_righteous_war:0 "A Righteous War"
 USA_OFN_a_righteous_war_desc:0 "Our mission for this campaign is set in stone. As the leader of the OFN, we will fight to ensure that all democracies stand and the freedom bell rings across every continent. We will fight to preserve liberty in South Africa, and we will stand for nothing less. If we can pull this off, we will certainly have an established power base in Africa."
 USA_OFN_AS_and_NZ:0 "Call on the Pacific"
 USA_OFN_AS_and_NZ_desc:0 "Australia needs us as much as we need them for the war effort. We just need to let the Australians know we're watching their Pacific territories and they will want in on our little war. We must ring up the Prime Minister and get him on our side as soon as possible."
 USA_OFN_protect_the_beacon:0 "Emergency Support"
 USA_OFN_protect_the_beacon_desc:0 "We are quickly losing ground in South Africa; the situation has worsened to the point that we may not see South Africa in the upcoming OFN summit. It is imperative that we provide South Africa with an emergency shipment of equipment to ensure that they will hold on until we can get our own troops to the battlefield. We must act fast; the democracy is struggling to stand."
 USA_OFN_the_economy:0 "It's the Economy, Stupid"
 USA_OFN_the_economy_desc:0 "Our military is weaker than it has been in a long time, and with the times changing and the relations between the great powers cooling off, we must use this war to power our military engine, once again. Some politicians have warned against a dangerous military-industrial complex, but they are weak and timid, to win wars we must be strong and bold!"
 USA_OFN_a_necessary_war:0 "A Necessary War"
 USA_OFN_a_necessary_war_desc:0 "This war must be fought! If we don't bring the war to the Nazi-fucks down in Africa, they will eventually bring the war to us on their terms, and we cannot have that happen. The war is necessary to secure the future of South Africa and keep the Eastern route to Asia safe. It is necessary because if we don't have safe ways to Asia, we sure as hell will lose future opportunities to increase our influences in Asia"
 USA_OFN_guards_iceland:0 "Rally Iceland"
 USA_OFN_guards_iceland_desc: "Iceland has been as one large military base, this has lead to many young Icelandic males training with the army and some have been trained in supporting roles, radio operators, field nurses, and engineers. Iceland don't have much to contribute to the war, but they can send their best support staff and take care of the soldiers."
 USA_OFN_guards_west_indies:0 "Rally the Guards: West Indies"
 USA_OFN_guards_west_indies_desc:0 "There are many, small islands that make up the West Indies Federation. Surely they must be able to gather at least one division. Its your duty, god damn it!"
 USA_OFN_guards_guyana:0 "Guards from Guyana"
 USA_OFN_guards_guyana_desc:0 "They probably don't have much to contribute with, but it sure as hell is their duty to use what they have to help. Go to Africa, you lazy Guyanese."
 USA_OFN_South_Africa_summit:0 "OFN Summit: South Africa"
 USA_OFN_South_Africa_summit_desc:0 "Our armies have been able to hold off the enemy just in time for the emergency summit to start. Thankfully, representatives from South Africa will be attending. With this summit, our leaders will plan a course for this war and discuss future South African participation. Once we finish, we will wreak havoc on all enemies of South Africa; their freedom will be secure."

Sound, tested models of administration and investment would unlock the economic potential of Africa! The Indian and South Atlantic Oceans would be secured for the free world!\n\nLike many foreign conquerors before them, they soon found their ambitions dashed. Their leadership found itself overwhelmed trying to make sense of the disparate tribes, factions and groupings and struggled just to maintain the status quo. Investments dried up as delays, red tape and petty corruption made a mockery of investment models and profit projections. Generals and politicians alike watched with horror as patrol after patrol failed to make it back to their bases.\n\nThe cumulative weight of all these setbacks have proven too much to bear for the Mandates and their masters, and they are now cutting their losses and leaving the territories."

 #New Nixon Events
 USA.ct.1.t:0 "Cracking Fortress Europe"
 USA.ct.1.desc:0 "President Nixon stared at the world map projected onto a screen in the White House briefing room. At the center was America, encircled, facing the Japanese and their colonial minions to the West and the Germans and their slave empire to the East.\n\nBut where the Japanese and the Americans had only recently escaped Armageddon's embrace in Hawaii, the Nazi empire was fraying at its seams. Hitler grew older and more infirm by the day; no amount of clever camera work and pre-recorded speeches could hide his creaking gait, his once-mesmerising oratory shrunken into senile rambling. Germany's moon landing was not a triumph - it was an epitaph.\n\nSecretary of Defense Melvin Laird looked up from the latest CIA intelligence brief on the German Reich. "It's a house of cards, Mr. President. Britain chafes under a foreign occupier, Brittany already deals with us in secret, and the Norwegians continue to resist decades of occupation. And their African colonies will wither on the vine without support."\n\n"All held together by a man who can't finish a sentence without forgetting how it started," Nixon noted.\n\n"When Hitler goes, his successors will fall over themselves to split the spoils, like Alexander's generals did in antiquity." Laird handed over a sheaf of documents from the CIA folder. "It's the opportunity of a lifetime. We'll never get another shot at crippling the Nazis like this.""
 USA.ct.1.a:0 "It's time to go back to the Old World."
 USA.ct.2.t:0 "The South African Tango"
 USA.ct.2.desc:0 "Secretary of State William Rogers was well familiar with the steps of the 'South African Tango'. The South African ambassador would ask in vague generalities about admission into the OFN, but without any real plans for common defense or tariff liberalization. The Secretary would, in turn, respond with vague updates on South Africa's application, now nearly a decade old.\n\nIt suited both parties; the South Africans wanted the threat of OFN membership to cow the Germans, and the OFN needed to preserve the last democracy in Africa. Neither, however, wanted a German intervention, which OFN membership could provoke. Thus, the South African Tango continued on, without end.\n\n"How can I help you today, Ambassador?" Roger struck a neutral tone to hide his boredom; he was near-certain that the response would be entirely predictable. "We're doing very well, and about that OFN application" would be the usual response --\n\n"The Germans are making their move." Ambassador Willem Christiaan Naude declared. "Hertzog's Boer nationalists are talking to the Germans. South Africa is in danger, and we need America's help."\n\nThat got Roger's attention, as his stomach dropped at this most unexpected turn in the decade-long discourse. "What kind of help are we talking about?"\n\n"Financial, intelligence, but above all, military." Naude said firmly. "If the Boers and Germans want a fight, we won't make it easy for them.""

 USA.ct.3.t:0 "Memorandum - Situation in South Africa"
 USA.ct.3.desc:0 "CLASSIFICATION: SECRET\n\nCENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY | DIRECTORATE OF INTELLIGENCE\n\nSubject: South African Political Assessment\n\nThe question of the vacant monarchy in South Africa symbolizes the political tensions pulling the nation between the German Reich and the remainder of the free world. The upcoming referendum has inflamed these divisions, with the pro-German and Boer-led National Party, led by Albert Hertzog, arguing to abolish the monarchy against the status-quo United Party of PM De Villiers Graaff.\n\nWith reports of German weaponry flooding Bloemfontein and with political violence escalating (see Memorandum - Assassination of B.J. Vorster), CIA assets report widespread concern in Cape Town that the referendum is cover for a declaration of Boer independence. This would rob South Africa of much of its strategic depth and provide a pretext for German intervention to support its new client state.\n\nSimultaneously, protests by the African National Congress (ANC) against widespread discrimination continue to roil the nation. The movement continues to gather strength despite the incarceration of much of the ANC's executive leadership, and moderates are increasingly being sidelined by militant radicals.\n\nThe center, it seems, cannot hold much longer."

 RD_D_compromise_a_103:0 "Country over party, gentlemen!"
 RD_D_compromise_b_103:0 "We won't fall on our swords for Nixon's sake!"
 RD_D_compromise_desc_103:0 "Some days, Vice-President John F. Kennedy hated his job. It wasn't just because President Nixon was a mercurial, ornery bastard. No, it was because sometimes Nixon would saddle Kennedy with the dirty work - to risk his reputation to save the President's. Now, not a year after talking the Japanese down, the President wanted to bankroll the Nazis ('but only the nice ones'), and Kennedy would talk the Democrats into supporting it.\n\nAs expected, Wallace F. Bennett and Al Gore Sr. both stared at Kennedy like he'd grown a second head.\n\n"Jesus, Jack!" Gore finally exclaimed. "You know your dad's reputation is still in the gutter over the war. How can you be okay with this?"\n\n"The president sure has it out for you after Hawaii," Bennett remarked. "But we're still being dragged down over losing the war. If this goes public, we'll be wiped out politically."\n\nThe comments stung deeply, but Kennedy made his pitch regardless. "Germany's rotting from the inside. We put Speer in power, and Germany will be in chaos as the various cliques fight him tooth and nail. We're doing this to end Germany, not help it!"\n\nAfter a long silence, Bennett spoke. "Even if you convince us, what about the rest of the caucus? We could be looking at another set of defections to the NPP. Can we afford that?""

 RD_R_compromise_desc_103:0 "An uncomfortable silence settled in the Oval Office as soon as Nixon outlined his plan to covertly support Albert Speer in the impending succession crisis in Germany. Lyndon B. Johnson and Nelson Rockefeller looked at each other worriedly.\n\n"Let me get this straight," Rockefeller said incredulously. "You want to use taxpayer money to covertly support a leading figure in the Nazi party? Not the British resistance, or the Russian warlords, but the Nazis?"\n\n"When Nelson puts it that way, it sounds like you're losing your marbles, Richard." Johnson drawled. "Hard to believe you're the same guy who put the screws to the German-American Bund with McCarthy years ago."\n\n"Just listen, damnit!" Nixon growled. "Speer's the only candidate to succeed Hitler who's even remotely inclined to talk to us. We get him into office, we can string Germany along with promises of lifting the embargo, so we can focus on Japan. His student radicals will keep Speer too busy to cause trouble. This isn't a threat; it's an opportunity."\n\nAnother worried silence. "If you really want this to happen, we can get the caucus to fall in line." Johnson finally said. "But it'll be a helluva fight getting everyone to agree to this. Hell, you might have people jump ship like Margaret Chase Smith did.""

Along its length rose a string of watchtowers, seawalls and concertina wire, their seams held together by trillions of Reichsmarks and the Führer's Aryan will. This stranglehold over the Old World goes by deceptive names like the Einheitspakt and Fortress Europa. The Free World calls it for what it is: a Steel Curtain.\n\nThe Volkshalle would have one believe that the Steel Curtain is as the Gibraltar Dam: impregnable, insurmountable, everlasting. In truth, the Curtain is pregnant with rot, surmounted by power struggles, and frail on its deathbed -- much like its architect Hitler. Subtle blows can make gaps out of its rustiest sections; there liberty's torchlight can filter back into the continent afresh."

Moreover, they assumed the German army had no business prevailing against the combined forces of two world empires, and that they will fold in a second war as they had in the first.\n\nGermany proved them wrong on all three accounts by raising the swastika over Paris and London. On that ignoble climax has America since been forced to leave its Allies' governments to Hitler's mercy.\n\nOperative word, says the CIA: governments.

Luckily, a force which can effect such exists in Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance. President Nixon pledges to uphold the Special Relationship both before and when America's other plays its hand."

Free England's fighters harbor their own visions for the nation's future -- proaction now, President Nixon's advisers suggest, will guarantee the inevitable power struggle's prevailing vision comporting comfortably to the Free World's own course.\n\nOne of the resistance's most agreeable factionheads also stands out as its most surprising: English Army general Claude Auchinleck. How India's former commander-in-chief has hidden his duplicity from London is a mystery; in any case, the man regaled Langley's contacts with fond recollections of America's valiant defense against Sealion.

Fascism's stain on Europe's ancient societies will linger for decades before it fades away -- if it ever fades at all.\n\nBut no volume of Nazi indoctrination can excise man's impulse to seek the illicit: the unknown, made alluring by its forbidden nature. How far the world has strayed that common decency is merely an exotic import to the Reich's citizenry... but they yearn for it regardless.

As arms shipments adopt tight schedules without authorities' notice and agents slip into and out of Fortress Europa with a revolving door's ease, the two countries' resistances ask Washington's leave to form closer ties with The Company.\n\nFor his part, President Nixon recalls the OSS's legendary exploits in its short-lived record.

Deadlock has unsurprisingly arisen over what said response should be.\n\nTo both parties' outrage, President Nixon suggests offering diplomatic recognition to Albert Speer. The noted reformist may ultimately be a Nazi, he defends, but no better opportunity to steer Germany from its excesses exists than in his accession as the Reich's new Führer. If nothing else, Speer seems more receptive of peace and cooperation than Göring, Bormann, and Heydrich.\n\nAmerica's eyes are on Capitol Hill as its statesmen-elect decide whether to fan the embers of German liberalism... or watch idly by as it turns to ash."

To say that the situation of the Republican-Democrats is dire would be the understatement of the century. Enter former Speaker of the House John McCormack, a man who never expected to hold the reins of power who has regardless found them thrust into his hands. At such a dark moment in America's history, McCormack will certainly have his work cut out for him.\n\nWith the election approaching, McCormack's tenure as President will be short. He has no intentions of running in the election, instead simply resolving to hold the Oval Office for the coming months until a new Commander-in-Chief can be nominated. However, with his party in shambles and the National Progressive Party making unprecedented gains, he intends to use his brief tenure to try and right the ship and save the Republican-Democrats from ruin.\n\nThe tarnished legacy of Nixon will need to be addressed, a matter President Kennedy was unable to attend to in his tragically brief rule. The fallout of the South Africa War that Nixon thrust the country into will need to be carefully managed as well. If McCormack can successfully put out the flames that his party is currently engulfed in and restore some semblance of dignity to the government, the Republican-Democratic party may just manage to pull through - or at the very least, survive absolute electoral decimation."

With many of the Democrats and even a few Republican senators openly wondering if the continued existence of the united party is beneficial to anyone, drastic action must be taken to pull the party together if we are ever to have a hope of salvaging the election.\n\nPresident McCormack will need to wrangle the squabbling factions into presenting a united front against the chaos America finds itself in. Restoring party unity will be critical to allay the nation's panic and prevent a mass defection of voters from the Republican-Democrats. "

By presenting himself as a non-partisan element, uninvolved in the unfortunate scandals of the past, McCormack can distance himself from the taint of the Nixon presidency.

The NPP insist that they and only they can be trusted to "fix" America, promising hardline solutions to America's problems as one might take a sledgehammer to a loose nail.\n\nIf the Republican-Democratic party is to endure, we must make the people of America see that the way of the NPP leads to ruin. President McCormack intends to go on the offensive, calling upon all red-blooded Americans to stand firm against radicalism. Their siren song, the likes of which has led to so much poverty and death in so many regimes in history, cannot be allowed to take hold in the United States as well.

Then Nixon lied and Kennedy died, and suddenly this Boston-born son of a hod carrier found himself thrust into the highest office in the land.\n\nThe days seemed to blur together as he struggled to gather himself. The Oval Office was a whirlwind of activity, endless lines of politicians and secretaries rushing to give him the lay of the land. "More rioting in the South" cried one. "Latest casualty reports from South Africa, Mr President" said another. The podium at the press conferences was another beast. He had lost count of the amount of times he had uttered the phrases "national tragedy" and "difficult times for us all" in front of flashing cameras over the last few days. Finally, whenever he found himself a brief moment to relax, he would pick up the newspaper and read all about the grim poll forecasts and the endless rumor mill and the countless reports of anti-war protests and continuing civil rights clashes and lines of coffins returning from overseas.\n\nOne night, sleep truly eluded him, and he found himself in the Oval Office, sitting in darkness save only for the lights flooding in from the White House lawn.

Newspapers, stat sheets, comuniques from all across the country; the contents of the papers were varied, but on each of them he had circled the particular stats he was looking for - the polls.\n\nThe New York Times said the R-Ds stood a good chance in Iowa, while the Boston Globe predicted a bloodbath in the NPP's favor. Pollsters in Illinois seemed confident that the Republican senator there would keep his seat, but the news from Louisiana was not so encouraging. Endlessly, McCormack gorged himself on poll numbers, feeling his heart sink at every poor showing and subsequently soar at every promising result.\n\nYet he felt himself growing increasingly frustrated as the pollsters seemed incapable of agreeing with one another, and the final result remained as unclear as ever. The uncertainty made him feel sick to his stomach. He knew he hadn't always made the right choices, and the NPP were stronger now than they had ever been before. Nixon and Kennedy were the reason he was in this mess, yet history would remember him as the man who made or broke the Republican Democrats.\n\nAs the night wore on, and the official vote counts began, McCormack felt his eyelids begin to droop. Resting his head upon a copy of the Washington Post, he felt his thoughts and fears ebb away. As sleep finally took him, he resigned himself to the knowledge that he would wake up to a brand new president. Whoever that might be."

Still lumbering around with heavy, full-size rifles in the form of the M-14, the Germans and Japanese have been rushing ahead with light rifles firing small caliber, high velocity cartridges. Now the United States may have an answer to these high-tech foreign weapons in the form of the Armalite AR-15. Firing an extremely high velocity, 5.56mm round, the AR-15 weighs in at a hair over 7 pounds when loaded.

The vehicle has an aluminum body that, while light, creates issues in survivability, both for the vehicle and the soldiers inside it. In order to improve the M113's capabilities, the Department of Defense has recommended outfitting it with steel armor slats, and even experimental, "reactive" armor plating that will improve its strength. In order to counteract the added weight of this extra armor, this upgraded M113 will feature a larger, turbocharged diesel engine. After implementing these potential upgrades, the U.S. Army's standard APC should see a notable increase in effectiveness."

The Academy is simply too small to handle all the recruits needed for our massive military, and, as such, many are forced to go to poorer schools, or even give up the officer corps as a whole.

This was important during the Pacific War, and it still is, but it cannot be the sum total of our focus. New research and funding needs to be put into submarine programs, to counter our enemies beneath the waves. We should also focus on expanding our nuclear triad in a variety of ways, so that we will not be reliant on silos and bombers to dominate the newest form of warfare.

In short, the report came to the conclusion that American sonar capabilities were insufficient in detecting new, silent-running German submersibles. The new submarines are able to run much quieter than their earlier counterparts, easily fooling American sonar technology. In response, the Department of Defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend the development and adoption of SQS-23 Sonar, which can operate at a much greater range of frequencies, and detect previously-undetectable silent craft.

Despite this versatility, however, they are being used in relatively small roles, such as reconnaissance. In order to exploit their full potential, a proposal has been made to the Department of Defense: divisions of helicopter-based mobile infantry.

As such, the Department of Defense has recommended the widespread adoption of laser-guided missiles. If America is to stay ahead of the curve in munitions technology, it may be prudent to invest research and development time into laser-guided munitions, which can track individual ground targets as the aircraft that fire them fly away to safety."

Previously, most propeller-driven aircraft relied upon machine guns or automatic cannons to engage with other aircraft; now, as jets become in the air forces of the world, this gun-based approach is simply no longer viable. Luckily, with the advent of guided air-to-air missiles (AAMs), the Department of the Air Force has possibly found a new approach. Should we invest in these munitions, our aircraft can expect a massive boost in combat effectiveness, as they will be able to hit the fastest of hostile jets without a second thought."

This fear is no longer countered by conventional means. With enemy bombers, it was a simple enough task to send interceptors to shoot them down. Now, however, ballistic missiles fly far higher and faster than even the fastest jets, and as a result, can no longer be countered conventionally.\n\nAs a solution, the Department of Defense has envisioned the Sentinel Program. In it, a series of low-range, anti-ballistic missile sites will be placed around the continental United States. If enemy missiles come nearby, these sites will fire guided missiles in response to intercept and destroy them. While these won't be able to do much against large ICBMs like those expected from the Reich or Japan, they should be able to shoot down the short-range missiles that our enemies place in their puppets close to us."

America will no longer be on the backfoot in tactics and strategy; rather, it will rush ahead with new, innovative combat concepts that will put it at the forefront of military doctrine. Among these innovations are helicopter-focused infantry, highly mobile ground units to outflank and surround enemy positions, and advanced naval detection technology and protocols.

However, Bennett's idea of trade was to move high paying manufacturing jobs from America's great cities to areas of the world that had weak unions, little protections and no need to pay their workers much above subsistence levels, and then selling what was made back to America. While this made the big companies that still owned the factories and the distribution methods rich, and helped those countries bolster their economies, it put thousands out of work here at home, and rippled through the American economy. We should rectify this balance, encourage the companies to return home and employ our citizens, even if it does make our friends and allies angry."

#Madagascar stuff
 USA.madagascar.1.t:0 "A Crack in the Facade"
 USA.madagascar.1.desc:0 "The National Security Council had been gathered by order of the president, and by recommendation of Treasury Secretary McNamara.\n\n"Now, Bob, you've told me this isn't just about the Madagascar blockade. It had better not be, you told me there would be no hang ups on that issue."\n\n"Not at all, Mister President," McNamara shifted slightly in his seat. "The Director of Central Intelligence actually asked me to have you convene the council." He glanced to the director, who held a pipe to his lips, his mouth curled into a glib smile.\n\n"Get on with it, then." the president urged. With a puff of smoke, he leaned in and began.\n\n"Mister President, we have contacts high up within the German colonial administration in Madagascar. We have total reason to believe that they have some ... misgivings about their loyalties to Berlin. With the weakening of the German empire, and with Hitler becoming increasingly ill, it's become apparent that a conflict may break out on the island sooner rather than later. We have word that rebels are planning to make their move soon, and the local government is divided."\n\nNixon shrugged. "Who are these contacts? Can we be sure of their sincerity?" McNamara pushed his glasses further up his nose; for dramatic effect, the director puffed again from his pipe. "Mister President, our contact is Reich Commissar Emil Maurice."\n\nNixon seemed stunned for a moment, but collected himself quickly. "My God, that's great. And he has a direct line to Hitler?" The director nodded. "Maurice is one of Hitler's oldest confidants. Their relationship has been strained as of late -- which is partly why he wants out -- and his word, we think, is good." Nixon nodded in silence for several moments before continuing.\n\n"Well, dammit, keep me updated on this. If you find any way to breach the bastion, you let me know immediately.""
 USA.madagascar.1.a:0 "Let's see if we can make a dent in the Unity-Pakt."

 USA.madagascar.2.t:0 "The Perfect Storm"
 USA.madagascar.2.desc:0 ""Mister President, we believe the dam is about to burst in Madagascar."\n\nMaurice wanted out. The perfect storm of pressures and crises seemed about ready to completely tear the Indian Ocean island apart. The president sat down in his chair, switching the phone to his left hand as he shifted through some papers on his desk. "What's going on? I haven't had any information in my daily briefings on the issue. The last I heard was when we spoke right after we lifted that blockade."\n\n"Well, Mister President, there is a pandemic of black plague across the countryside. The Jews in the North are getting uppity, so to say, especially because of the chaos back in the mother country. SS units across the island have been in constant contact with Himmler and his underlings. Maurice is terrified he may be shot any day by his own guards. And the natives may revolt soon, as well. For what it's worth, we agree with his assessment that Madagascar is about to become a warzone."\n\nA perfect storm, alright. "Well, give it to me straight. What are our options? Realistically speaking, that is."\n\n"Well, Mister President, you have two realistic options. The Agency can affect the delivery of several crates of weapons -- rifles, grenades, pistols, the like -- for Maurice to hand out to his loyalists. The other option is to simply hand him a lump sum of money. He can then use that sum for bribery, or purchases of his own, or what have you.""
 USA.madagascar.2.a:0 "We are the arsenal of democracy, after all."
 USA.madagascar.2.ab:0 "Money makes the world go 'round."

 USA.madagascar.3.t:0 "Shalom auf Madagaskar!"
 USA.madagascar.3.desc:0 "Today international observers have reported the final victory of the Jewish partisan movement on Madagascar. A local militia commander, near the city center of Toamasina, was quoted as saying that their success was "just the first of many plans of revenge" for the horrors of previous decades.\n\nChaos still reigns in many parts of the island as what remaining German loyalists flee or go into hiding. As the beginnings of a proper government begin to form, however, there is light at the end of the tunnel. The Director of Central Intelligence is upset over the outcome. For his part, President Nixon is quietly annoyed, but publicly exuberant. A reporter for CBS News quoted an aide of the president as being "excited for the possibilities of a free Madagascar in the future," and hailing "the beginning of the end of global fascist terror."\n\nStill, few Americans even know what a Madagascar is, much less understand the complexities of the issues that have led to this moment."
 USA.madagascar.3.a:0 "It could have been worse, I guess."

 USA.madagascar.4.t:0 "The German Loyalists Hold The Line"
 USA.madagascar.4.desc:0 "Today international observers have reported a seemingly final victory for the German garrison on Madagascar. Large convoys of trucks, loaded with captured militiamen, partisans, and suspected collaborators and sympathizers -- Jewish, natives, and others alike -- are photographed and filmed on their way into the countryside -- where their fate is unknown.\n\nEven despite the German victory, chaos still reigns in many parts of the country. Command hierarchy among the troops suffers greatly the further from the capital one goes, with revenge killings and attacks carried out on unsuspecting civilians and villages -- regardless of their true or suspected sympathies. It will take a great deal of time for the economy to recover, as well. The scars of war are never fully healed.\n\nThe White House has issued a statement hammering "Nazi tyranny" and has declared its intention to double its efforts in combating "global fascist terror". The bellicose rhetoric hasn't inspired any responses of note from Germany or Japan, and whether the president's statement is true or not remains to be seen. For now, Madagascar will remain under foreign domination, its people exploited and oppressed in the name of the glory of the Third Reich."
 USA.madagascar.4.a:0 "Another blow to liberty -- and the CIA."

 USA.madagascar.5.t:0 "A Crushing Victory"
 USA.madagascar.5.desc:0 ""Mister President, we've achieved a crushing victory! Our boys in Madagascar have won."\n\nSomething of an overstatement, [GetPresidentLastName] thought. He really preferred these phone conversations over meeting the man in person -- but now, he was growing tired even of this. "Yes, director. Congratulations on your operation. You did a hell of a job." Madagascar was now under OFN jurisdiction for the time being -- and hopefully would stay that way. But there were many questions of the future that remained to be answered.\n\n"No, Mister President, the success is all yours." There was an awkward pause. "Your statement to that reporter earlier today was very nice, if I do say so myself."\n\nNo shit, the president thought. "Yes, thank you. I think it's important we continually reinforce our intentions to support a transition to democracy. That's why we got involved in the first place, after all."\n\n"Yes, very good, Mister President," the director said. "With any luck, this is just the first of many great victories under this administration.""
 USA.madagascar.5.a:0 "Perhaps not a crushing victory, but a victory nonetheless."

 USA.madagascar.6.t:0 "Masters of Their Own House"
 USA.madagascar.6.desc:0 "Today international observers have reported a final victory for the native militias and rebel brigades on Madagascar. Flags of the colonial regime and of German are trampled and spat upon, torn to bits, and lit on fire; statues toppled; government collaborators beaten to within an inch of their lives or outright killed; and public monuments and government buildings defaced. For the first time since the 19th century, Madagascar is free.\n\nThe first pillars of the so-called Madagascarian Republic have been erected. Soon, tranquility, law, and peace will return to the island -- or so many hope. Of course, the result isn't exactly what the CIA or the president's closest allies hoped for, but a free people strongly opposed to German domination is a good friend, indeed.\n\nPresident [GetPresidentLastName], however, is wary. He remembers the crisis that gripped Guyana in its slide toward autocracy; in some ways, he sees similarities in the creation of the independent Madagascarian government. Only time may tell, however, whether Madagascar will truly embrace freedom."
 USA.madagascar.6.a:0 "We welcome the people of Madagascar into the concert of free nations."

 USA.madagascar.7.t:0 "Liberty Leading the People Again"
 USA.madagascar.7.desc:0 "The powers of the great coalitions and alliances of human history have always weighed back and forth like a great scale. And now, as the Unitypakt stumbled, OFN chose to strike at the opportune moment.\n\nAt the president's direction, and with significant monetary assistance from the State Department, the United Coalition Government of Madagascar, a sort of stop-gap measure, has been established. The endgoal of the intervention is the creation of an OFN-friendly sovereign government, completely free from German and Nazi influence. So far, the effort seems to have been successful.\n\nFuture politics is largely put aside in the name of total unity and opposition against the Germans and their agents. It will certainly not last, but for now there is stability among the friends to America and its OFN allies."
 USA.madagascar.7.a:0 "Once more, unto the breach."

USA_running_on_fumes_desc:0 "To say that the recent Oil Crisis has thrown a wrench into our economy is a vast understatement. Much like a well functioning machine, the US economy is heavily reliant on a steady supply of petroleum to work efficiently. While oil reserves exist in states like California and Texas, it is simply not enough to provide for the ever-growing needs of our population. The recent economic malaise of the past few decades is still fresh in the minds of America, and as such, preventing another, potentially worse crisis is paramount to our survival. A Presidential Task Force will be formed to secure new sources of oil, calm down internal strife, and apply a handful of administrative measures to resolve this issue. We can survive anything the world throws at us!"
USA_set_the_prices_desc:0 "Opportunistic businessmen have already implemented outrageous prices on the cost of gasoline and oil related products. This cannot stand! Effective immediately, the Federal Government will implement wide-reaching price controls and permit an efficient system of enforcement to ensure that no ludicrous pricing slips through the cracks. While the... less ethical viewpoint of this crisis would be to sustain profit, we must ensure affordability for the common consumer. Price controls will also help us slow down our soon-to-increase inflation rate, and provide some more stability in local markets. Those who are looking to personally profit off such a disastrous crisis must be restricted and taught the error of their ways, for the good of the nation."
USA_the_Federal_Energy_Office_desc:0 "Our current and past Administrations have not had any dedicated resources to meet the energy requirements of the country. With the current crisis in full swing, this can no longer stand. Through an Executive Order and hopefully action from the Legislative Branch, we can create an Agency which is responsible for managing as well as allocating our supply of electricity, collect information on the power needs of America, coordinate foreign policy measures to keep our trade of natural resources which can produce energy, and can regulate prices. While the Office will of course increase efficiency and scope with time, and perhaps even become a fully fledged cabinet-level department one day, their efforts now will help manage this crisis to a point where it does not strain an unprepared bureaucracy."
USA_Bigger_in_Texas_desc:0 "Texas is one of the largest producers of crude oil in the world. Despite this fact, it is not enough to keep up with the needs of Domestic oil use. Although there are already plenty of corporations drilling for oil in the area, it is not enough. We need to encourage existing drillers to expand, new drillers to set up rigs, and subsidise their businesses so they don't immediately go under from the weight of their expenses. Hopefully with all of this initiative going forward, Texan oil will heat homes during winters in New Jersey, power trucks on interstate highways in Utah, and keep industries running in Florida long enough for us to sort all of this out."
USA_Odd_Even_Rationing_desc:0 "Despite creating efficiency bottlenecks, enforcing strict price controls, and increasing our immediate as well as future supply of oil, it is simply not enough. This is a full-blown national emergency, and as such we will have to enforce rationing on our markets. Our system can't work as well as it is able to if our supply of oil isn't evenly spread. Businesses, private citizens, or agencies hoarding supplies of gasoline or crude oil supplies is simply unacceptable. We have a responsibility to ensure an even supply spread; perhaps even implementing ration cards and expanding the powers of the Federal Energy Office to punish those who do not comply. A thinly-spread supply of oil is better than no oil for some, as it goes."
USA_Synthetic_Alternatives_desc:0 "Recent advances in technology and scientific research has offered potential breakthroughs in alternative supplies of fuel. Although existing technology has already existed and was implemented by the Germans during the Second World War, it is now at a point where it is efficient and advanced enough to contribute to civilian supplies of fuel. Experts and cabinet advisors are skeptical about the short-term application of subsidizing such an experimental process, given that the scale it will be implemented on is mild at best. However, with time and enough funds thrown their way, we're sure that a stable supply of synthetics will at the very least reduce the negative impacts of future energy crises. Let's send a stimulus package to these scientists and industrialists as well as officially support their efforts, so that perhaps we have alternatives to rely upon a few years from now."
USA_Disaster_Averted_desc:0 "Through all of our efforts, we are starting to see miniscule signs of recovery. Despite there still being long lines at gas stations, a lack of supply in some areas, and a general slowdown of the entire economy, things are beginning to return to normal. Many policy experts and key figures in our administration are confident that the worst is over. Despite the Crisis still being in full swing, it is at least starting to slow down on the home front, with our economy showing signs of life again. We can now return to approaching our domestic agenda without fear of the entire country imploding in on itself from a lack of fuel. As we remember the impacts of this crisis and the consequences of past losses on the American consciousness, we can now steadily move forward to a safe and secure future, one where the public is protected from emergencies and the American Dream can still survive against overwhelming odds."
USA_reach_out_to_Riyadh_desc:0 "Saudi Arabia holds more cheap oil than any other nation on Earth. Miles of oil wells have stuck out of its dunes for decades, pumping millions of barrels of liquid gold a day. Italian colonialism expanded these lucrative fields to new plays underneath both the desert sands and the Persian Gulf. In a twist of irony, the Arabian Desert is now an oasis for a planet famished for oil.\n\nThe President's advisors unanimously believe King Faisal is America's ticket out of the Oil Crisis. However, its ideal method of approach is still subject to debate. Some believe Arabia needs firm reassurances from the Free World, up to and especially a tour de force. Conversely, others warn of the risks involved in repeating the South African and Indonesian debacles, instead advocating for diplomacy and more... clandestine, means to support the monarch."
USA_Securing_Our_Interests_desc:0 "America runs a race against an oil market on the brink of freefall; if it fails, then so too will its economy. In these precarious circumstances, mistakes made of haste are more easily forgiven if they ultimately preserve the country's fortunes.\n\nWashington is sure to make plenty of mistakes by intervening overtly in the Arabian peninsula, to say nothing of the political capital it needs to convince Congress and the people in favor of another foreign adventure. Rest easy knowing that the sacrifices we make now will pay off for millions of Americans' lives decades into the future. Prosperity, after all, makes forgiveness an easy choice."
USA_Gifts_For_The_King_desc:0 "King Faisal holds sway over a nation-state's embryo. He may have government, culture, recognition and rule of law - but without the guns to back its monopoly on violence, his dynasty may as well be one more tribe among the Arabian peninsula's lawless bedouins. More specifically, Bedouins vulnerable to the nationalistic overtures of a united Arab identity.\n\nHere America can leverage its economic largesse to buttress the young nation's precarious position. A shipment of guns both outdated and state-of-the-art will assure the King of his state's lastingness in the face of a subcontinent's worth of foes."
USA_King_Faisal_Im_CIA_desc:0 "The fruits of human intelligence compound with every year they operate within a country's borders. In turn, a well-established intelligence apparatus both forewarns and precludes enemy action, sometimes without their knowledge.\n\nWhich is why the CIA is so eager to expand their operations in the Middle East as of late. Our stiletto in the dark needs ample preparation time to conduct their covert deeds - we can satisfy their demands by sending them into the region before our armed forces. The Company will wreak their infamous havoc where we need it most soon enough."
USA_Operation_Sandstorm_desc:0 "As of late, the Joint Chiefs of Staff busied themselves with preparing America's most comprehensive expeditionary force since Indonesia. Drawing from the lessons learned in the past decade's two largest wars, the country's finest generals and admirals drew minute, extensive plans for a lightning war involving all four branches of the US Armed Forces. They described the immense firepower America's tanks, guns, ships and planes combined will demonstrate as a "shock and awe campaign" spanning the Middle East, routinely inspected for any flaws that may lead to another quagmire.\n\nAll told, the Pentagon assured America that Sandstorm will promise just that: a storm. Woe betide the fools who bar its path."
USA_Step_Up_Our_Shipments_desc:0 "Our army lives and dies by supply routes thousands of miles astride the East Coast and the Persian Gulf. As their principal supplier, said supply routes likewise dictate the Royal Saudi Land Forces' shape, tempo and effectiveness. Heavier combat necessitates several thousands more tons of shipment sent per day; should our logistics fail to meet the armies' demands, we will likely see both their ammunition and morale plummet deep enough to hit a reservoir of oil.\n\nThe simple solution is to increase the pace of convoys running extant routes. We can always rely on our capable merchant marine to implement this directive to their abilities' best."
USA_Black_Gold_Rush_desc:0 "One immeasurable benefit of direct cooperation with Saudi Arabia is direct access to their pipelines bursting full with oil. Their generosity has thus far ably stemmed the bleeding on America's economy since the Oil Crisis began. With war on their doorstep, and the US Army their most stalwart shield against it, the Saudis believe dedicating some of their valuable pumps solely for our army's consumption - after their extracts leave the refineries, of course - will service both themselves and us in the short, medium, and long term.\n\nReally, who are we to disagree?"
USA_Pick_Your_Targets_desc:0 "The CIA's contacts have proven their worth by providing every last iota of intelligence they can gather about our adversaries' leaders. Blueprints, photographs, sensitive documents, and even hearsay all blended into coherent narratives and routines involving the Middle East's most famous and infamous. The lax environments their abodes exhibit would scream danger to our agents - were they tasked with protecting them. Instead, the CIA saw only chances gaping wide open.\n\nWith the leaders' lives laid bare before the Company's omnipresent eyes, certain personages believe now is the most opportune time to plunge our stiletto in the dark behind their backs."
USA_Finding_Their_Leaders_desc:0 "Pan-Arabism is a mass movement, with its corresponding strengths, weaknesses, and weaknesses disguised as strengths. In particular, the ideology has mobilized millions throughout the Middle East around several charismatic ideologues like Arafat and al Sadat. If the presence of such men inflamed the people's passions, then would not their sudden, abrupt absence snuff these passions out?\n\nThe United States government has always been a staunch advocate of evidence based policy. As its foremost experts in unconventional policymaking, Langley has been tasked to make conclusive results out of Pan-Arabism's greatest progeny."
USA_In_For_The_Kill_desc:0 "What America needs the least in the middle of its greatest economic crisis since the Depression is a protracted conflict sucking its money and attention. South Africa and Indonesia had played merry hell on both - and that was with a healthy economy. From White House to janitor, America's government has wholeheartedly resolved to prevent Saudi Arabia from spiraling into a worse repeat of the last two wars that had wasted its energies and fortunes.\n\nTo this end, the President has requested that the Pentagon draw a time table for military operations in the Middle East, immediately followed by withdrawal plans upon the war's conclusion. If Washington has its way, then American soldiers will not spend any more time in the sandbox than they absolutely must."

USA.oilcrisis.1.t:0 "The Earth Bleeds"
USA.oilcrisis.1.desc:0 "The horrible fighting has begun again.\n\nBeneath the shifting sands of the Middle East oil pumps like blood through the veins of some slumbering primordial deity. Proboscoid derricks pierce the sediment in their hundreds, gluttonously sucking up the earth's bounty to feed the world's limitless thirst for petroleum. It is strange, absurd even, to think that the most valuable commodity in the world, and, indeed, the grease that spins society's cogs is little more than the corpses of prehistoric flora. And yet, every day, America burns through uncountable tons of this ancient biomass, without which our nation would grind to a screeching halt.\n\nPerhaps the only thing in the Middle East older than the land itself is the people. They wandered the sands for a thousand generations before the first city, and will surely do so again after the fall of the last. Entrenched in their ancient ways, they fought and married each other for millennia in the neverending dance of civilization, and every so often, as the years ground by, the cradle of humanity exploded into sudden and ferocious violence.\n\nOnce more, blood is spilled on the sand. Under the Italian boot for decades, the Arabs have risen up to form the nascent United Arab Republic, intent on expelling the foreigners from their homeland and taking claim of their own destiny. As the Italians desperately try to stop the spread of rebellion, the Saudi king watches from Riyadh, perhaps seeing his opportunity to grip the region in an iron fist.\n\nOur diplomatic staff, terrified of the distant explosions and gunfire they can hear from their offices, have been sending in frantic reports on the escalating crisis. Reading between the lines, the central message is clear: our oil supply is threatened. The situation appears bleak. America may soon find itself deprived of oil unless we act, soon and decisively. As the Middle East embroils itself in bloodshed, the policy-makers in Washington debate about what action to take, and our men in the Middle East are airlifted to safety, one thing is certain: it is happening again."
USA.oilcrisis.1.a:0 "The wheel of ages turns once more."

USA.oilcrisis.2.t:0 "Capital Is Commodities"
USA.oilcrisis.2.desc:0 "Wall Street is the heart of the American economy, and today it's beating harder than ever. Turmoil erupted on the trading floor after our plan to set prices on oil became public, and what can only be described as mass hysteria ensued as traders followed the trail of current events to the ongoing crisis in the Middle East, realizing the way the wind was blowing.\n\nThankfully it proved to be a minor hiccup, and the chaos on the trading floor quickly died down. Despite the initial hullabaloo, setting prices on oil has allowed us to maintain control of Wall Street and keep the markets relatively stable, averting the economic disaster many of our advisors were certain was imminent.\n\nOf course, we've made a lot of people angry. Commodities traders in particular are unsurprisingly furious, but the anger of a gang of hair-gelled smooth-talking champagne-drinkers is a small price to pay to avoid economic meltdown."
USA.oilcrisis.2.a:0 "Sell, sell, sell!"

USA.oilcrisis.3.t:0 "A Momentary Embolism"
USA.oilcrisis.3.desc:0 "Looming disaster has been avoided, for now, and oil flows again freely through America's veins thanks to our oil rationing and price-setting and the expansion of our domestic petroleum industry. Now our citizens can once again drive to their dead-end jobs and heat up their TV dinners without fear of impediment!\n\nAnd thank goodness for that, because without oil America would come apart like a house of cards in a tropical typhoon. Nevertheless, we can't let ourselves become complacent. The turmoil in the Middle East doesn't look like it's going to stop any time soon, and although the brunt of the crisis has been averted for the time being, if the violence escalates we can expect a similarly chaotic impact on America's markets. Our oil supplies are already stretched pretty far, and the worse it gets the more draconian our response will have to be just to keep the wheels spinning.\n\nFrankly, the reports coming in from our men in the Middle East are getting bleaker by the day. Oil distribution is still far from secure, and it appears as if none of the players have the power to end this conflict quickly. Most worryingly, we've just received a report from the CIA about several UAR nations joining into a single political entity, but who's to say if it's accurate? All kinds of rumours are pouring in, and it's getting more and more difficult to separate the truth from the baseless gossip.\n\nRight now there's no way to tell which way the wind is blowing, and that kind of uncertainty isn't good for anyone. We'll have to wait and see, but at least it seems the worst has been avoided.\n\nFor now."

USA.oilcrisis.4.t:0 "Our Man in Riyadh"
USA.oilcrisis.4.desc:0 "As the airplane's doors opened, the heat hit Bruce in the face like a nuclear blast. To a Minnesota boy used to freezing winters and mild summers, it was like stepping into a kiln. Christ, he knew it was going to be hot but this was something else. Lucifer himself would sweat in this.\n\nBruce gathered his resolve and started down the airstair to the scorching tarmac of the runway. He could already feel his shirt moistening and, after only a few seconds in Riyadh, he understood instantly why the Arabs wore those billowing robes.\n\nParked ostentatiously in the middle of the airstrip was a Rolls Royce, dark green as far as he could tell through the light reflecting blindingly off the chassis. The chauffeur opened the rear door. Bruce gave him a nod and ducked inside.\n\nGod is merciful: it was air-conditioned. Hell's bells, thought Bruce, an air-conditioned car is a luxury even back in the States and here's one in the middle of the damn desert. Sitting opposite him, and flanked by two extremely large bodyguards, was Crown Prince Khalid, swathed in enough white cloth to sew a sail for a Spanish treasure galleon. He shook Khalid's hand as the Crown Prince scrutinised him through his aviator sunglasses and responded to his pleasantries in impeccable English. "A pleasure, Mr. Laingen," he said, although his face betrayed little.\n\nAs they were driven to the Palace, Bruce and the Crown Prince stiltedly discussed the region's ongoing conflict, Bruce assuring the Prince of America's unwavering commitment to Saudi Arabia in the face of the crisis. Nevertheless, as the two discussed the merits of this or that policy, Bruce couldn't get the Rolls Royce out of his head. This man is driven in a Rolls, he thought, when his grandfather rode a camel. Would his grandson also drive a Rolls, or would the House of Saud once again ride camels over Arabia's shifting sands?"
USA.oilcrisis.4.a:0 "How long can they conjure money from the desert?"

USA.oilcrisis.5.t:0 "Smoke on the Wind"
USA.oilcrisis.5.desc:0 "Bruce Laingen sat resting his head on his palm, reading and re-reading the communique from Washington. He'd been ensconced in the American embassy for days, drafting policy plans in the searing heat, ceiling fans going full bore. They often revolved so fast he was half-afraid they'd spin off their axes and decapitate him. Frankly, now he'd received his orders, he was almost starting to hope for it.\n\nWith a sigh, he called in Agent Hunt, one of the latest concrete cowboys Langley had sent him. Like most Agency men in the field, Hunt was a red-blooded American with a taste for beer, football and shooting foreigners. Bruce had an almost instantaneous dislike for the man, but if they were going to be forced to work together, they may as well try and be civil. After all, personality conflicts aside, they were striving for the same goal. Bruce lit a cigarette, and offered one to Hunt. He tossed the communique over to Hunt's side of the desk.\n\n"The President's decided to put boots on the ground," he said laconically, in a carefully neutral tone of voice. He had become paranoid lately that his office might be bugged, by either the Saudis or the Agency, and did not want to give them any indication that he was doubting the efficacy of the slowly escalating policy of interventionism in the Middle East.\n\nHunt glanced over the document, then flicked his eyes to Bruce's. "We'd better get ready then, is what you're saying," he said, a barely perceptible grin on his face.\n\nBruce nodded. "Get everyone organized, the first of them are gonna be here pretty damn soon and we're nowhere near ready to receive them. And for god's sake, get Frank to keep the Saudis off my damn back!"\n\nHunt stood, and flashed Bruce a pearly white smile as he made for the door. "Hot damn, it's gonna be just like another South Africa!""

He found it darkly amusing to see the normally so uptight Saudis sitting around smoking, drinking and groping dancing girls, all the vices they spent so much hypocritical breath decrying.\n\nThe King himself had apparently been handsome in his youth, but Bruce couldn't see any evidence of it now. Surrounded by giggling wives and concubines a third of his age, the King was bloated, droopy and covered in liver spots. He reminded Bruce of a scoop of rum and raisin ice cream that had been left sitting in the sun.\n\nAnd yet, despite all outward appearances, King Faisal was one of the shrewdest political operators he'd ever met. The man was wily as a fox.\n\nBruce noticed suddenly that the King was looking in his direction. He beckoned for Bruce to come to him at the other end of the table, and Bruce went without hesitation. When the King beckons, you come.\n\nThe King liked to project an urbane aura when speaking to Westerners, but Bruce could detect the hint of menace lurking beneath the King's friendly facade. "My dear Mr. Laingen! I did not know you were here. A pleasure to see you once again in the Palace! I trust things are progressing at the Embassy?"\n\nSneaky bastard, thought Bruce. He knows full well I was on the guest list. His reply, however, was far more deferential. "Yes, your majesty. Our defence and intelligence network has been thoroughly established. Our agents are at your disposal to root out the traitors to your rule."\n\nThe King smiled, but his eyes were as cold and immovable as a glacier. "My dear Bruce, I must commend you!

German diplomats have made their nation's displeasure clear, calling us hypocrites for running operations in the no-fly zone. Germany's opposition, of course, does not come from a love of peace but from a desire to protect their sometime-allies in the pan-Arabist movement, presumably afraid that an unfriendly faction taking control of the region could throttle their oil supply.\n\nUltimately, what do we care what they think? Germany is unlikely to put boots on the ground in the Middle East in order to avoid a confrontation, and, after all, we're in desperate need of the oil too. Better we pump it into America rather than allow it to grease the gears of the cruellest superpower in history."

USA.oilcrisis.9.desc:0 "You'd have to be a damn fool to trust the Saudis, but they're the only native group in the region even slightly friendly to the US. Nobody could say that they were reliable, but having the Saudis on our side gives us a valuable beachhead into the Middle East to protect exports of precious, precious oil.\n\nNevertheless, the values of Saudi Arabia are distasteful even to the most hardline reactionaries back home, and it's getting increasingly difficult to justify our alignment with a nation so diametrically opposed to the virtues of freedom and liberty that Americans hold dear. It's hard to see the Saudis as the lesser of two evils when they deny women even the most basic rights and behead political and religious prisoners like some kind of medieval warlord. Some commentators back home are even comparing the pan-Arabists to the American revolutionaries of the 18th century, which, presumably, would cast us in the role of King George.\n\nIf we're going to back the Saudis, it's our responsibility to try and nudge them away from hardline conservative Salafism. The idea of a republican or, Allah forgive me for uttering this word, secular Arabia is a pipe dream, but if we carefully influence Saudi thought leaders we can perhaps engender positive social change in Arabia and avoid the mistakes of the old apartheid regime in Guyana.\n\nThe CIA's current plan is a covert operation to influence the hearts and minds of Saudi Arabians who might be sympathetic to our ideals, mainly non-Salafist intellectuals and the petit bourgeois. The Saudi upper crust would balk at sudden change, but perhaps over the next few decades of our association with them we can nudge the oil kingdom in a brighter direction."

Every war creates refugees, but the sudden brutality of the conflict in the Middle East is annihilating ancient ways of life and sending people fleeing from the land their ancestors have occupied for centuries in a way never seen before, and they're all flocking to what appears to be the last remaining beacon of stability in the region: the Saudi Kingdom.\n\nMost of them aren't exactly friendly to Saudi or Western interests, but more than that, they fear and hate the men who expelled them from their homes. As the pan-Arabists spread their tentacles over more and more of the Middle East, that hate could be a powerful weapon against an increasingly dangerous enemy.\n\nOur man in Riyadh, veteran diplomat Bruce Laingen, has presented us with a plan drawn up by two CIA operatives under his command, Frank Sturgis and E. Howard Hunt. It suggests training and arming the refugees and sending them back into the fray as a totally deniable army to fight the pan-Arabists without smearing red, white and blue across the Middle East. If it seems like we're uninvolved, the local response will likely be far more amenable to a native army whose interests just happen to coincide with our own. This could be a way for us to exert our influence in the region without having to send our boys to die in the desert."

The towering date palms let very little light into the courtyard, and in the twilight it was filled with a dim purple glow. By a shimmering pool sat King Faisal, sipping coffee from a silver goblet.\n\nThe King motioned for Bruce to sit. At some unspoken signal the garden was suddenly empty. The King set his coffee down and gazed into the pool. At last he began to speak, not looking up.\n\n"America is a young country, is it not? Forged in the fires of revolution some two centuries past. Indeed, the very ideals that drive your nation are scarcely older than America itself."\n\nHe glanced up to meet Bruce's eyes, and Bruce shuddered in the coldness of his gaze. "We are an old culture. The legacy of the Arab people goes back far further than your own, our way of life is founded on values and ideals millennia older than yours. Our faith in God is the driving force behind our society, tradition its cornerstone. You must come to understand this or someday the desert will consume you as it has so many others."\n\nThe garden darkened as the sun slipped below the horizon. "I love to sit here after the rain," confided the King, leaning back in his chair and folding his hands over his belly. "The coolness after a storm is a rare pleasure in Riyadh. Imagine the hubris to construct a garden such as this! This palace and its garden will be here long after America has crumbled into the sands of time, and the ways of our people will exist as unchanged in the years to come as they have for so many centuries." He glanced over at Bruce. "I hope you understand."\n\nBruce heard the message loud and clear: the King wanted an end to the CIA's program of liberalization. Heart in his throat, he felt a sudden burst of fury at the veiled threats of this decrepit old wreck. "Your people once built great gardens in Cordoba, your majesty, before the forces of Christendom burned them to the ground. You should consider the fate of the Moors before you make threats."\n\nWith that he rose, and left the King to sit alone in the twilit darkness of his garden."

They've even held several secret meetings with the ones most sympathetic to their degenerate views.\n\nFaith and tradition are the cornerstones of our society, without them we are nothing. We're perfectly happy to accept American money and American guns, but they can keep their corrupt values. It's time we identify those they've influenced and make sure they're silenced. The Americans can hardly just pull their aid, not when they're as oil-starved as they are, and that might be all we need to put an end to the toxic ideas spewing forth from the American embassy.\n\nOur ways have survived the long ages and a parade of conquerors, whose bones lie forgotten under the sands while we carry on.

Our new planes are set to soon arrive at Port Dammam, and our boys in Riyadh have already drawn up plans for ambitious missions against the pan-Arabist menace.\n\nWe don't plan to let the Middle East and its oil escape our grasp just 'cause the limp-wrists back home balk at the idea of dropping a few million tons of bombs on people who are fighting, as we once did, for their freedom, liberty and right to self-determination.

Our supply of oil is not ensured, while our enemies in the region are starved of their main source of funding.\n\nNow that we've got a good, tight stranglehold over outgoing trade, we can throttle the enemy until they're crying uncle.

USA.oilcrisis.15.desc:0 "Bruce sipped at his drink of choice, a Long Island iced tea, as Agent Hunt sat across from him in his sweltering office, telling him in furiously animated detail of how the Saudi police have begun to harass American operatives, irrespective of whether or not they're involved in the liberalization program. The icy cold drink and the frantically rotating ceiling fans did little to cool him down.\n\nAfter Hunt left in a huff, swearing that something had to be done about "those damn slimy Arabs", Bruce sat back, wondering what was to be done. He got up and walked to the window, flicking open the Venetian blinds. Past the low, white buildings of Riyadh he could see the endless desert expanse, stretching all the way out into the scorching nothingness of the Empty Quarter. The view reminded him often of what Minnesota might look like if it was covered in sand. Like Arabia, the only round things in Minnesota were the fruit on the trees and some of the people.\n\nAnd yet, despite the similarity of the land they inhabited, the people of Minnesota and Arabia couldn't have been more different. He often found himself unable to understand why the locals did anything they did, why they held onto these bizarre, archaic beliefs. It was like living in a kingdom from the Dark Ages that had been dumped into the twentieth century.\n\nBruce closed the blinds and went to sit back behind his desk, slumping into the chair, still moist with his sweat. The authoritarian Saudi police would have to be dealt with if Americans were to operate unrestricted through the country. The Saudis would hate it, of course, and he had little doubt that the King and the Crown Prince would try every possible tactic to keep the status quo, but if they didn't stop harassing American operatives they'd feel the wrath of Uncle Sam.\n\nHe took a page and began to draft up some ideas to handle the situation, narrowing it down to two main contenders: play nice with the Saudis, maybe throw them a bone or two, or serve them a veiled threat by reminding them that America could pull out and cut off their lifeline if they didn't get back over the line."

Bruce had spent the morning in a series of meetings with a rotating gang of Saudi officials, ministers of one sort or another, all of whom looked exactly the same: portly, bearded men wearing aviator sunglasses and enough white cloth to make a hot air balloon. Bruce was forced to repeat himself with each one of them: reform their authoritarian and overzealous police force, or suffer a reduction in American funding.\n\nTheir reaction was invariably the same. It consisted of a brief explanation of the importance in the kingdom of Sharia law, tradition, faith, yadda yadda. All stuff he'd heard before, and like before he found it impossible to believe after seeing what the Saudi upper crust were like behind closed doors. When he had requested to meet with the King, or the Crown Prince, he was told blankly that they were not receiving visitors. Frankly, he wasn't surprised he was on the King's shit-list after their little confrontation in the garden, but now he couldn't even talk to him?\n\nSo the Saudis wanted to play hardball did they? Well, two could play at that game. Back in his stifling office, Bruce wondered how to deal with them. God knew he wanted to turn the screws on the bastards, but the angel on his shoulder was being very insistent in telling him to take the high road and back off. Even so, he couldn't shake off his anger at their condescension, brushing him off like he wasn't threatening to throttle their aid. He narrowed his eyes. Surely they had to be bluffing...?"

He swung to his terrified secretary, a cringing suburbanite from Long Island. "Get the hell out!" he spat. She vanished from the room faster than Bruce's hopes for a quiet day without trouble from the Saudis.\n\nBruce slumped into his chair, the leather instantly sticking his shirt to his back. It was the Chinese, he recalled, who cursed people by wishing them to live in interesting times. The Saudis were making his life extremely interesting indeed. His attempt to intimidate the Saudis by threatening to pull out had been a complete and utter failure. He could almost feel Faisal and Khalid and the rest of the aviator-wearing bastards laughing at him in the Palace.\n\nBruce laid his head in his hands. The Saudis knew America needed them, and they knew America was desperate for oil. He was supposed to be working them, and yet somehow they'd maneuvered him into a corner. Faisal was calling the shots now, and he had sent a letter filled with extremely thinly veiled threats, in essence a demand for the CIA's social liberalization program to be discontinued and for American interference in Saudi internal politics to be immediately halted. There was the suggestion that further interference could result in a butterfly effect leading to a halt in oil shipments to the United States. It didn't take a genius to read between the lines there.\n\nWell, Bruce thought, they've sure got us over a barrel here. He sighed. After all, what did he care about democracy in the Middle East? As long as the oil kingdom kept up the shipments, Washington would be happy."

The usual suspects, in other words.\n\nBruce plastered a smile on his face, hoping he didn't look too ingenuous. After their tiff in the garden, he was surprised but glad the King had agreed to meet with him. He may have grown to hate the slippery, corpulent warlord, but god knows America needed a stable oil-exporting ally in the region, and the Saudis were just about the only option.\n\nAfter the stilted pleasantries, the real discussion began, both sides trying to get as much as possible from their opponent while giving up as little as possible, the endless dance of diplomacy, negotiating and bargaining. Bruce was in his element. Determined to control himself, he gave the Saudis several minor concessions they wanted. It seemed to make them happy, but with the Saudis it was difficult to tell.\n\nFinally, after over an hour of dancing around it, the central point came up at last. Bruce's attempts to play nice with the Saudis had at least gotten his foot in the door, and now it was time to wedge the door open or forever give it up. As much as they pretended at supreme military dominance, Bruce knew the Saudi military was far from the juggernaut the King wished he had at his disposal. He could, of course, just play it cool, restore friendly relations and avoid further embarrassment... or, he considered, he could offer them the weapons agreement he knew they wanted. If a bunch of new toys couldn't mollify Faisal and get him to cooperate, Bruce reflected grimly, it was probable nothing would."

Next would be the tanks, and the helicopters, and the cargo loads of guns, explosives, yadda yadda.\n\nHe drew the blinds and sat down. The King was signing the laws to put a leash on his overzealous police force and to allow a few token liberalizations in a closed ceremony in the Palace. It hadn't even made the news, which Bruce was sure wasn't an accident. Along with the seemingly endless materiel, the Saudis were getting millions more in aid and development funds siphoned by the Agency's oh-so-clever accountants in Washington.\n\nAs he listened to the trucks rumble past, Bruce blackly sipped his coffee. When he thought about it, the Saudis had gotten a hell of a lot more out of his agreement than he'd managed to get for America. He felt like a customer in a bazaar who thought he'd gotten a great bargain out of a haggle but had actually gotten swindled. He'd been warned Faisal was an infamous political operator, and yet somehow along the way Bruce had let him get the better of him. He supposed he'd had a chance to get the upper hand at some point, but he must have missed it. He almost had to admire them for it. Almost.\n\nFaisal and Khalid and the rest of them must be having a good laugh up at the Palace at having got one over on that degenerate heathen American. And yet, what could he possibly have done? America needed the Saudis on their side, for better or for worse. Anything as long as it kept the oil flowing.\n\nFinishing his coffee, Bruce sighed, and hoped it wouldn't be long until he could go home to the snowy plains of Minnesota, and never have to step foot in the desert again."

After a minute, he realized they weren't coming back.\n\nAs he was driven back to the embassy, Bruce sat in the back seat in the depths of a fell mood, his every muscle tensed. When he had offered a new weapons agreement to the King in exchange for token liberalizations and further cooperation from his government, the King had sneered, calling the United States weak and decadent. His ministers and the Crown Prince rising with him, King Faisal had declared that he would never compromise the deeply held beliefs and values of the Arabian people to appease America, especially not for what he deemed a "bribe". The King left sneering, cursing Americans as servants of Mammon.\n\nBruce was fuming. He couldn't shake the feeling that this was somehow personal, the King's retaliation for the harsh words they had exchanged in the garden. Could the man really be so vain that he would sacrifice such a one-sided deal for something so petty? Perhaps he had underestimated Faisal and his coterie.\n\nOf course, this didn't mark the end of America's association with the Saudis. They had become entangled into a frankly dangerous symbiotic relationship, the Saudis relying on America's military power and influence, and the Americans on Saudi oil. And here he was, Bruce Laingen of Butterfield, Minnesota, somehow caught up in the middle of it.\n\nGoddamn it all, he thought. All he could do now was try to satisfy Washington without rocking the boat too much. It was clear now that there would never be democracy in the Middle East if they were unwilling to give up their medieval practices. As long as the oil kept flowing Stateside, it would be enough.\n\nBruce leaned back into the richly upholstered leather, and dreamed of returning to the snowy fields of Minnesota."

Whether from rigs off the Louisiana coast or the bountiful wells in the Arabian Peninsula, cheap oil is the linchpin keeping the world's strongest economy strong from the bottom up.\n\nThen one sunny day in the turn of the decade, oil prices quadruple to $12 a barrel. And like an engine with neither lubricant nor fuel, the world's strongest economy sputters into a sudden stop. Pandemonium strikes Wall Street's floors as indexes dovetail past their troughs with no signs of slowing down, let alone stopping. Main Street fares little better: look only at the miles-long lines of cars outside gas stations across the country, both awaiting shipments of fuel that will never come. As conflagrations spark abroad, the crisis they have brought to America's shores have skyrocketed the prices of goods while simultaneously keeping people from earning money for them - in other words, a cataclysm poised to stunt, even reverse, a decade of growth.\n\nAmerica turns desperately to Capitol Hill for an answer to the world's first ever oil shock.

Their inability to contain, or at least moderate, the Arab people's unrest has caused wave after wave of disruptions to the world's largest supplier of cheap sweet crude oil. With Congress near-unanimous in their apathy for the ailing and aloof empire's miserable fortunes, Washington has decided that supporting the movements to break the peninsula free from Rome's talons will most help in stabilizing the region and, in turn, its oil wells.\n\nStill, even proponents of pro-Arab intervention are divided over both its extents and its recipient. Vigorous debate has sprung over whether America should lend its hand to Yasser Arafat's Baathists in the United Arab Republic, or to the influential House of Saud and its patriarch King Faisal. If ambiguous over said hand's size, shape and delivery, then President [Root.GetName] has at least settled the prior argument by deciding in favor of..."

His agents have noticed a steady increase in anti-war rhetoric: newspapers, radio broadcasts and several opposition politicians are criticizing the choice to send "our boys" to "die in the jungles and quagmires of a god-forsaken hell" and, while the tones are still kept civil, small non-violent protests and marches are breaking up in counties where the draft has been felt more extensively.\n\nWhile the effects of such propaganda are still limited, the report considers "very likely" that a prosecution of the hostilities with the Afrika-Schild will only worsen the current state of affairs, and urges "immediate gains" to quell the discontent, or we'll risk facing a severely worse situation in the next months."

USA.saf.effects.4.desc:0 "The village had no name. On the US maps of the area, it was called Hamlet 773. Like so many others, It was a squalid collection of huts whose inhabitants made their meagre living by grazing cattle. It would forever have avoided the pages of history, if it wasn't for one ill-fated patrol.\n\nAnd so, in the baking heat of the afternoon, they came. A group of American soldiers strode into Hamlet 773, guns out. It had been months since any Americans had come their way, and they all came out to see them. Their leader was a boy with pimples on his face. He indicated the oldest man present, the village elder, and began to shout at him, his voice cracking, his pale face growing red.\n\nThe elder, unable to speak English, tried to figure out what he wanted, but the boy soon lost patience. He shouted at his troops, and they moved into the huts, ransacking them. As the elder approached the American to ask him to stop, the boy struck him to the ground. Lights swam behind the elder's eyes as he wiped the blood from his face. He could hear shouting, in Tswana and English. Looking through clouded eyes, he saw a group of women approach the boy, pointing at him and yelling. The elder tried to entreat them to calm, but the words died in his throat.\n\nEverything after that happened so suddenly. A girl ran from the group. She didn't get five paces before a shot rang through the air and she dropped like a ragdoll. The elder tried to rise, fell. Shots tore through the air above him. Silence. Then the wailing began.\n\nIt hadn't taken more than ten seconds. Gathering what little remained of his strength, the elder rose to his knees. Twisted bodies lay everywhere. Women, children. The American boy was shouting, his voice cracking. The elder looked back to his people, the few still upright keening, wide-eyed with horror. He began to crawl, but felt his spirit fading, like a cloud passing into the distance. Fainter, fainter..."

They waited with goosebumped flesh for the loud voices from Heaven to proclaim the world becoming that of the Kingdom of God and his Messiah, and the salvation of their immortal souls.\n\nIt was then that the infernal craft came from the sky, and the horns were joined by guitar and drum and a voice like wailing, and the farmers cowered at what they now recognised as their destruction. The sky lit up like the pits of the abyss, and flames rained down upon them, and smoke filled the air, and ghastly filth poured over the land to wither all it touched.\n\nThrough it all the farmers shrieked and cried as their lives were ripped from them. Some sought to comfort loved ones, others begged for the Lord's mercy. Young men ran in futility as their elders kneeled and awaited the brutal heat and sudden cold of death.\n\nIn but a few short minutes life was wiped from the bushveld, and not a one of them remained to see the American commander lean out of his helicopter to taste the air. He breathed deeply of the smoke and ash of his creation, and he knew it was good as he gazed upon the blasted landscape, devastation undreamt of by any conqueror of antiquity. The commander looked to the vastness above and said a silent prayer to the same God the Boers begged to save them as they burned. The helicopters left back through the smoke, leaving the cratered annihilation and its piles of black ash behind them, ash that had once been men who had hoped and dreamed and loved.\n\nLater, they would learn intel had been mistaken, and the village was not the rebel enclave they had thought it to be, but by then they had moved on to burn other villages in other lands, and it mattered little to them and was soon forgotten."

Backed by the bleak vastness of the sky, the weary Americans passed through the kraal.\n\nIt was barely a village, a collection of shacks made of rubbish and dry wood, a handful of emaciated goats and sheep who gazed forlornly on the men as they made their way into the centre of the feeble settlement. Their leader, a boy with patchy fuzz on his upper lip, looked around him into the houses, and saw in the gaps between planks the sullen red faces sneering at him with the hateful eyes of the conquered.\n\nEvacuate, he called, once, twice. They only glared and snarled in their pig-speech, and the boy felt his anger stoked at their contempt. Forward, he motioned, and the masked men approached with their strange machines, and the villagers watched them in confusion.\n\nWithout further warning, fire poured forth and the shacks went up in flames. Screaming, they began to flee, clutching babies and valuables, crashing to the ground as shots ripped through the air, tearing into their sunburned skin in fountains of blood.\n\nWithin minutes, the all-consuming fire had cleansed the village from the face of the Earth. All that remained was the ash, and the bodies, and the boy-commander gazing upon the destruction he had wrought with faraway eyes. Sifting through the remains, the Americans found no evidence of the hidden Boer cache they had come so far to find. As dry thunder boomed over the highveld, they turned and returned the way they had come, between the jagged rocks, back down the sandy road."

The mud was littered with corpses - children, women, old men. There didn't seem to be any of draft-age, or any with weapons.\n\nThompson ordered the helicopter to land in the centre of the village, where he could see a few Americans milling about. He disembarked and, as he approached the nearest private, he was startled by an African woman stumbling from a nearby hut, naked, groaning, blood running down her legs. A shot rang out. Her head blew apart in a fountain of brain matter and skull fragments. The woman's body slammed to the dirt in a pool of gore.\n\nA man came out from the hut, stepping over the corpse, one hand holding his pistol and the other doing up his zipper. "Who's in charge here?" demanded Thompson.\n\n"That'd be me", said the soldier, unaffected. "Name's Calley. You our relief?" Thompson stared at him in horror as an enfilade of shots rang out behind him, at the other end of the village. He got into Calley's unshaken face. "Just what in the hell is going on here, Lieutenant?"\n\n"Just following orders," replied Calley, "giving these savages a taste of American firepower."\n\n"But- these are unarmed civilians, human beings, sir!" More shots. Thompson winced. Calley lit a cigarette. "Look buddy, this is my show. I'm in charge here. If you ain't interested in doing your damn job why don't you fuck off back to your chopper and mind your own business?"\n\nThompson carefully glanced around. Calley's men were staring at him, slowly moving towards him from the sides, surrounding him. "You ain't heard the last of this!", he snarled impotently as he stepped back into the helicopter. Raising over the village, he saw a group of soldiers push a handful of girls and old men into a ditch and open fire.\n\nThompson desperately tried to raise the colonel on the radio, receiving only static.

Blonde hair, blue eyes, the German pedigree. The rags of his uniform identified him as an officer of the SS. A shot to the spine had left him paralyzed below the waist, and he had laid there since the battle in a pool of his own filth, drinking tainted rainwater from the mud and praying for a clean death. He would not get it.\n\nThe German fumbled for his gun as he saw the Americans approach, but they got to him first. It was all the excuse they needed. The men of Tiger Force tied cables around his legs and attached them to the back of the APC, then took him on a spin through the grime of the battlefield, dragging him over the ruined bodies of his comrades, through the congealed gore. First he shouted, then he screamed, then he begged and cried and called for his Mutti, and finally he was silent.\n\nAt a sharp turn, his head was dashed against a rock, shattering his skull, his brain matter splattering across the mud.

He braced himself for what he knew was coming.\n\nNow that he had awoken, the torture began anew. One of the men punched him full force in the stomach and the chest, over and over again as the other watched, asking questions he didn't know the answers to. After a time, the torturer went to wash his hands clean while the Boer spat blood onto the concrete floor. It glistened in the harsh yellow glare of the sodium lights.\n\nNext came the pliers. He was determined not to scream, but his resolve broke immediately as the frowning torturer ripped out his thumbnail. The questioner continued in his monotonous drone, speaking the Afrikaans of one who had not been born to it. Where were they, how many were there, where were the supplies coming from. All the Boer could say was that he did not know, but they were not satisfied. After his remaining fingernails were lying on the floor in pools of blood, the torturer went to work on his teeth.\n\nAfter a time, the Boer awoke. He wondered how much time had passed in the dank, stinking cellar. The torturer wheeled a car battery forward and attached jumper cables to it, then clipped the clamps to his nipples. The Boer felt electricity light his brain up like a Christmas tree. For a moment the shock was so strong he didn't even feel the pain, but it came. Oh, it came. When he proved once again unable to answer their questions, the torturer swapped the clamps to his testicles.\n\nEventually, morning came. In an alley in Cape Town, down by the docks, a nondescript door opened. A young man with slicked-back red hair walked outside into the dim sunlight, rolling his shoulders and stretching his neck. Behind him, he awkwardly dragged a garbage bag, the contents sloshing around with every step. He heaved it into an already overflowing dumpster, and, shielding his eyes from morning's bright light, made his way back inside.\n\nSoon, they would be bringing in the next prisoner."

Tanks, helicopters and all kinds of weapons and explosives were littered across the continent in abandoned camps. Among this bounty, claimed by the Americans, was the Germans' invisible killer: poison gas.\n\nAs the men of Tiger Force advanced across the savannah, they ransacked many such camps, eventually coming into possession of a sizable stock of gas grenades, which they carried around with them, itching to find some krauts to use them on.\n\nIt was a regular patrol, to yet another of the half-empty hamlets that dotted the savannah. Their radio was on the fritz again, so as they milled around waiting for new orders, they decided to play a game: see how far away they could chuck a gas grenade into the village's well.\n\nA ruddy-faced corporal eventually managed it at ten paces. As the grenade clattered down into the well, they heard the pin get ripped out and the hiss of the gas filling the well as the grenade sunk into the water.\n\nAn old African approached them, yelling, repeating "Poison, poison!" over and over again. With a sneer the corporal shoved him to the dirt, his buddies laughing. Their laughter was cut short as more villagers came out of their huts, first curious to see what all the fuss was about, then furious. The elder stood, his nose bloodied, and began to shout at them. The other villagers were shouting too, closing in.\n\nWhen they stood before the panel at their disciplinary hearing, every man of Tiger Force said they didn't know who had fired the first shot, or who had thrown the poison grenade into the village's only source of water. Nevertheless, when the smoke had cleared, the ground was littered with shattered corpses. The few survivors were evacuated from their ancestral lands and, as the days went by, the plants and animals withered and died as the poison spread through the soil.

Acknowledging, he set the wheels of destruction in motion. If he had given it any thought he would have assumed they were carrying weapons or enemy troops, but he didn't think, or, more likely, simply didn't care. It is easy to deal death from a distance, never having to look into the enemy's eyes, hear them cry and scream and beg for mercy.\n\nThe bombs screamed downward, whistling through the air, but the pilot didn't hear them. Before their impact, there was a moment of peace that seemed to stretch for an eternity, where everything was locked where it was. Then the explosions blasted across the savannah, blowing apart the trucks in an eruption of twisted metal.\n\nSatisfied with a job well done, the pilot turned back to base. He would never see the villagers running to the shattered remains of the convoy, horrified to see their shipment of vital supplies obliterated, not a scrap remaining, and the road torn apart, their only lifeline to the outside world.\n\nHe would never see the children starving, the people dying of curable disease, the death and agony of their eventual migration away from their ancestral lands, desperate to survive. That flash of metal in the sky, sighted above the village for a split second, had forever decided their destinies, destroying lives, wiping a whole community from the map, but the man who had pushed the button would know none of this.

Some held photos of husbands, children, brothers whose bodies - lost in the jungle or mangled beyond recognition - they couldn't even hold for a last goodbye, others posters decrying the "useless sacrifice" of human lives and accusing the "bloodthirsty capitalists" who "feed on death" to be the true force behind the government's decision to increase the draft.\n\nThe guards outside were visibly in difficulty: they surrounded the small crowd, but didn't try to dislodge them as they were unarmed and quiet. They didn't scream or try to force the block: they all waited there, and looked at a certain window, where a certain person was looking back.

While it wasn't a full on defeat, it's hard to claim a victory, as much as President [USA.GetLeader] and his supporters try to spin it. Sure, South Africa still exists and can hold free and fair-elections, but the three Reichskommisariats have strengthened their position in Africa, and have established an allied-Boer Republic, reducing our ally to a rump state.\n\nThe result has seen the American people bitterly divided: all the sacrifice that had been made to keep South Africa free and defeat the Nazi's was apparently wasted, as South Africa is now smaller and weaker, and the RK's are stronger than ever. If just another division had been sent earlier, or more bombing runs had been launched, or just a bit more effort had been made, then the war would have gone differently, and we wouldn't be left with this unsatisfying, and unstable victory. Others say we should have cut and run sooner, so the casualties and news reports of dead soldiers and brunt villages didn't cause the public morale collapse, or resulted in the deaths of many young men. The what-ifs and could-have-beens, however, will have to be left to the historians and the President's political opponents to fight over in the future.\n\nWhile the fighting is over for now, it's clear that South Africa will need our assistance and help to survive, and to maintain a toehold in Africa."

At the same time, the OFN was unable to erase the stain of Fascism from Africa, so the status quo remains.\n\nPresident [USA.GetLeader] maintains that the goal of the intervention in Africa was just this: protecting our allies and "containing" Nazism to it's current borders and preventing it from spreading like a disease around the world. However, many politicians and generals stated their desire to drive the fascists back, and liberate all of sub-saharan Africa from our ideological opponents. While these words were more hopeful than concrete policy goals, a decent chunk of the general public that had heard time and time again that America was fighting for democracy and freedom are not content with what some are calling a "half-finished war."

Despite constant aerial bombings from increasingly desperate defenders, the South African army, supported by elements of the OFN coalition, has taken Windhoek, administrative center of Reichskommissariat Südwestafrika, after almost a day of furious fighting. The central compound of the colonial government was the last sector of the city to fall, as almost two hundred soldiers, supported by a battalion of the native SS, had bunkered in the heavily-fortified building, forcing the American troops to clear the underground corridors and booby-trapped halls with flamethrowers and military engineers.\n\nThe last weeks had seen the combined Allied troops inflicting defeat after defeat against the Reichskommissariat, steadily gaining ground against a weakened and demoralized opponent, but this might be the turning point for the war: with the fall of Windhoek, the Schild has lost its largest air fields, and large supplies fuel and airplane parts have been seized by the attackers before the Germans could retreat.\n\nReikscommissar Schenck has managed to flee the city on his personal fighter, and in his first statement he has sworn "to bring back the German flag to Windhoek ", but with the western front in disarray and Schild troops still retreating, many doubt whether he'll be able to keep faith to his word."

On the contrary, the defeat spurred the Reichskommissariate to reorganize and react: after several days spent planning and concentrating troops and supplies, the Oberkommando der Afrikanischen Streitkräfte launched a general offensive on the occupied city. Troops from the entire coalition attacked with fierceness bordering desperation, and despite heavy losses managed to push the frontline until the South Africans and their American allies had to fall back to the outskirts of the city.\n\nIt was immediately evident how ill-prepared had been the defenders, as they never thought the Germans would actually be able to react to the last defeat. Bombing runs from Südwestafrikaner pilots, eager to get revenge for the humiliation, quickly neutralized the scattered anti-aircraft batteries and proceeded to hammer the garrison with all kinds of payloads. Rather than suffering heavy losses, the commander preferred to retreat from the city, and convoys filled with soldiers and supplies quickly left the cities the night before the attack.\n\nThe following day, the German troops entered the liberated Windhoek in triumph, though the locals seemed less than happy to welcome their saviors. Reichskommissar Schenck returned to the city hailed by his soldiers, and resumed his post in the administrative compound, now under heavy repairs. The victory has been broadcasted all the way to Germania, and reinvigorated the morale of the Afrika-Schild.

Situated very close to the initial frontlines of the war, Bloemfontein, capital of the newly-established Boer Republic, had little time to prepare: despite the efforts of the garrison commander, lack of manpower and materials due to the poor industrial development of the region meant that only makeshift defences, mainly a few prefabricated bunkers, trenches and anti-aircraft batteries scattered throughout the outskirts, could be erected in time for the South African offensive.\n\nDespite a fierce resistance, the city garrison couldn't repel the attackers and was soon forced to retreat inwards: emergency barricades were built by auxiliaries, and several buildings were booby-trapped or set on fire to slow down the foe, but in the end it wasn't enough. After a brief last stand in the town hall, the officer in command of the city agreed to the surrender terms offered by the Federation: the civilian irregulars were disarmed and allowed to return to their families, while all others were taken prisoners.\n\nEven though the government evacuated the city long before the offensive began, due to safety reasons, the fall of Bloemfontein is still a hard blow to take for the Boer cause. Morale is falling all throughout the insurgent forces, and many have begun to question their German allies: if this is how the war is turning out to be, then it may not be long before peace returns.

In a strange mockery of time and human fortunes, the South African commander surrendered at the very table where his Boer predecessor had done the same thing.\n\nWith the liberation of Bloemfontein, the frontline has returned as it was at the start of the war, and many within South Africa are worried that the offensive might spill inside the country, forcing them to assume defensive positions to avoid further ground losses.

Despite the valiant efforts of the Boer soldiers, they couldn't resist the impetus, and were forced back to the city center. There, they found many defensive positions sabotaged by ANC partisans, which eventually forced the commander to surrender.\n\nWith the fall of Johanasburg, the Boers have lost not only their largest settlement, but also their only developed industrial sector, effectively crippling their war production: this will make much more difficult for them to keep fighting effectively, and many agree that this might be the beginning of the end for this ill-fated uprising."

While most of the soldiers managed to retreat in order, there weren't enough transports to take in the ANC partisans, who accused the Americans of having betrayed them. As they had nowhere to run, they decided to fight to the last man rather than surrendering: they fell one by one waging a fierce guerrilla against the advancing Boers, sabotaging several industrial facilities and dealing much heavier losses than they took, until they were completely vanquished.\n\nWith the liberation of Johanasburg, the Republic has regained control of its industrial core, and reparations are already underway to bring the military production plants to full efficiency.

The order of the addends doesn't change the result: in what comes as a surprise for most, and as a horrible nightmare for the Afrika-Schild, Libreville, the largest port of the westernmost Reichskommissariat, and the main source for their supplies from the mainland Reich and has fallen to American and South African marines.\n\nWith the cover of darkness, and supported by several naval units "borrowed" from the US Navy to their ally, the joint OFN task force launched a large naval invasion against this vital infrastructure. As the port itself was lightly defended, and most of the garrison had been sent to the front, there was little the remaining guards could do as hundreds of marines attacked in unison, and heavy naval batteries pounded what little defenses surrounded the docks.\n\nAlready, military engineers have started turning the city into a fortress with whatever they can find at hand, and the port facilities are being repaired for unknown purposes. As Zentralafrika hurries to defend its vulnerable belly, the American-led coalition has already achieved an important victory: by opening a second front directly in the heart of Deutsch-Afrika, they have managed to force their opponent to divert a significant contingent from the main front to the South, severely weakening their frontline. Should the Schild fail to retake Libreville, not only would the flow of supplies from the motherland abruptly end, but it would be the start of a devastating pincer move which could theoretically cause a general collapse of the German colonial alliance."

It seems the concrete risk of total defeat awakened the German Reichskommissariate from their torpor: frantic call for arms were emitted, emergency reserves called into service, and the efficient German production plants, fuelled by the death throes of so many unfortunate souls, churned out an endless supply of weapons at the price of thousands more lives in a clean, mathematical proportion. Before the Americans could reinforce the disembarked naval garrison with proper ground troops, the full might of the German war machine was unleashed upon Libreville.\n\nSuddenly, he night was set ablaze by the simultaneous fire from dozens of explosions, and the few who were still asleep were forcibly torn from their dreams by the sounds of explosions and airplanes filling the sky. The marines held their ground and fought fiercely, supported by the constant barrage from the ships anchored at the docks, but they found themselves under attack by an enemy they couldn't hope to defeat: pioneers cleared the minefields and tank traps, while panzers rammed hastily-erected barricades and infantry quickly moved in to seize key points of the defensive line.\n\nThe defenders retreated in order to the port and quickly boarded their ships as they took the sea, thanks to the fact that the Germans carefully avoided bombing the port facilities; still not everyone could find place inside, and many fell in German hands. As the Afrika-Schild draws a collective breath of relief from the averted catastrophe, and the American government faces heavy criticism at home for the hundreds of soldiers dead or captured in what newspapers have called "the Bay of Fools", all contenders return their undivided attention to the main front.

Now, they await to know their fate as it is unclear whether they are actual soldiers or "armed civilians".\n\nWith the fall of Leopoldville, Zentralafrika is on the brink of collapse, and the entire Schild hangs precariously in the balance: unless bold actions are taken, and victory follows, the war will be lost.

Perhaps this was what spurred the German soldiers to fight even more fiercely than usual, or perhaps it was desperation, but in the end the result didn't change.\n\nThe American garrison fought in the jungles surrounding the city in a desperate attempt to hold back the enemy advance, but they were forced to retreat when the vegetation was set aflame by napalm bombings, and Zentralafrikaner helicopters hunted the scattered bands till the outskirts, where they were forced to retreat by the anti-aircraft batteries hurriedly mounted on the former central compound of the colonial administration. The symbolic value of the building didn't stop the Schild from heavily bombing it, further weakening the defenses before the final push. In the end, most of the garrison managed to leave the city before it fell by seizing several civilian boats and retreating through the lake towards their still-fighting comrades. Müller was reportedly "heartbroken" when he saw his most prized trophies used as "bedside tables and practice targets", and has sworn bitter revenge against those who perpetrated such a sacrilege.\n\nPerhaps this newfound rage will lead Zentralafrika towards a renewed impetus, but the situation remains extremely difficult for the German coalition: with large swathes of the Reichskommissariat still occupied, many doubt that the victory will do anything more than delaying the inevitable, especially with the western front still open like a festering wound.

What the garrison couldn't expect, however, was an enemy from the inside: though it's unknown whether they took contact with the besieging army, or if they acted on their own, partisan movements all throughout the city's many concentration camps and slave quarters launched a full-scale uprising, slaughtering their jailers and breaking free, spreading chaos and panic in the German quarters of the city. This distraction gave the attackers the perfect opportunity to strike and, despite taking heavy losses, they managed to dislodge the garrison from the outer bastions and enter the urban areas. The last sector to fall was the fortress-complex of the central administration compound, which had been riddled with boody-traps and death zones: over six hundreds soldiers died to take the building from the few dozens of fanatical German SS barricaded there, before military engineers and flamethrower teams were sent in.\n\nQuelimane was a vital hub for the colony, and hosted several industries fundamental to the war effort: the victorious occupants were reportedly "shocked" by what they saw in the countless mining concentration camps and slave factories, where tens of thousands of desperate men, women and children lived in abject poverty and starvation: many were moved to tears as some of the weakest ones died before their very eyes, crying of happiness for being free at last.

What followed was one of the greatest tragedies to befall this bloodied land.\n\nAerial reconnaissance had showed only minimal troop movements near the city, and the garrison believed they could hold out in the hastily-repaired German defences: this belief soon turned hollow, as the attackers made use of an unmarked web of tunnels, known only to the highest officers, to secretly enter the city at night. Silently, like snakes stalking their prey with the cover of night, SS snipers surgically removed all sentinels and took position around the barracks, waiting for the signal: as soon as it arrived - a single artillery shot - the poisonous jaws closed, and slaughter began.\n\nThe defenders couldn't even take up arms as they were riddled with bullets in their beds, while the units secretly assembled in the forests surrounding the city moved in. No surrender terms were offered to the American commander: he and the few survivors were dragged from the central compound they had bunkered in, tortured for information, and summarily executed, the photos of their mangled corpses sent to the American command to show that Reichskommissar Hüttig always, ALWAYS keeps his promises. The worst, however, came after the victory, as all non-Germans within the city were declared "traitors to the Aryan race": the soldiers simply entered camps, tents, houses and began killing.

One by one, the bunkers were busted by surgical artillery and aerial strikes and tanks moved in to seize the entrenched defenders still fighting.

When the Schild launched a full-scale offensive, few were still capable of fighting, and even retreating to more defensible positions in the center proved useless, but when the garrison commander finally surrendered, he was shocked to hear the terms. With the only other alternative being mass execution, they were requested to enact decimation: one every ten soldiers would be selected by chance under German surveillance, and killed by his own comrades.

Despite losing its status of an economic center due to the years of apartheid, which saw most of its white population leaving for greener pastures, the city was still an important logistical junction, allowing supplies from Cape Town and the increasingly frequent American shipments to directly reach the eastern front.\n\nThe city had been heavily fortified for the coming assault, with several artillery and anti-aircraft emplacements scattered in the many squares and parks dotting the city, while the outskirts had been torn down and replaced with interlocking bunkers, trenches and minefields. Still, this wasn't enough to hold off the attackers, as the joint German-Boer task forces used napalm and heavy artillery to clear the outer defenses, creating a breach large enough for the close quarters specialists to reach their intended targets. The garrison fought back valiantly, with important support from those civilians who preferred to fight and die rather than live in slavery, but in the end they were forced to concede more and more ground, until a last defensive line was hurriedly formed around the harbour: all possible supplies were loaded on any availabe ship to not let it fall in German hand, but many were left behind and had to surrender and face the war prisoners' camps.\n\nThe American commander in South Africa has vowed to "free the people from the national socialist yoke", and already rumors are starting to circulate about heavier investments in the war, but this defeat is drawing heavy criticism for how the American expedition was ill-prepared for this conflict, and many doubt that the tides of war will change.

However, even such preparations weren't enough to resist as the entirety of the German war machine was thrown at the defenders. Boer artillery, supplied by their German allies, surgically removed a large part of the air defenses, and then Südwestafrikaner bombers unleashed hell upon the city in the form of incendiary bombings and bunker-busting payloads. Table Mountain and the Twelve Apostles were riddled with craters, while Signal Hill was captured and turned into an advanced artillery position to fire directly into the inner urban areas. In the end, the pressure became too much, and the joint High Command ordered a full retreat from the city by sea.\n\nWith the fall of its capital, South Africa loses also its largest industrial center and recruitment pool, severely crippling the war effort. In Washington, the American government is currently under attack by several newspapers and prominent opposition politicians, who decry the "useless sacrifice of American lives" and ask for total disengagement from this "humiliating disaster". Meanwhile, as the ashes cool down, the new Boer military administration, helped by German personnel, has already started implementing apartheid. The South African government, evacuated from the city before the attack, has promised to retake the city, but is this still possible?"

USA.saf.war.missions.18.t:0 "The Second Battle of Cape Town"
USA.saf.war.missions.18.desc:0 "Perhaps the war isn't over yet, and there's still some fighting spirit among the South Africans. In what came as a sudden change to the one-sided course of the war, the last reserves of the Federal army, heavily supported by elements of the American Navy and driven by determination bordering on desperation, launched a full-scale offensive against their capital.\n\nThe new occupants of the city hadn't had the time to repair the fortifications surrounding the city, and were forced to fight in ruined bunkers and half-buried trenches. At the same time, a general uprising from the population, who hadn't been taking well the newly imposed apartheid, forced the Boer command to divert several units from key locations around the ring of forts, further weakening the already too strained defenses and finally forcing a geneal retreat from the hills. With the defenders surrounded from all sides, the officer in command finally surrendered in the morning: the coalition troops entered a wounded, but jubilant city, while their enemies hurried to reach their captors before they could be lynched by the enraged mob.\n\nThis victory comes as an utterly unexpected development in a war that already defies all known parameters: the German war machine has suffered a strong blow, and the industries of Cape Town will be a boon for the South African army as soon as they are repaired, returning a modicum of autonomy to an army which now completely depends on American supplies. At this point, no one knows whether this will be the proverbial swansong before ultimate defeat, or the beginning of the comeback for the Federation."

USA.saf.war.missions.19.t:0 "Rage Against the Administration"
USA.saf.war.missions.19.desc:0 "With the war in South Africa escalating, the President has issued a new draft directed towards young able-bodied men. Tens of thousands will be requested to join the army and, after their training is over, will depart for the frontline. Everyone knows many of them won't return, and this has caused widespread protests as many fear their loved ones will be among the victims: spontaneous marches and picket lines can be already seen in large cities, but the harshest backlash has come from the drafted themselves.\n\nRather than showing what [USA.GetLeader] has called "proud American spirit", thousands of college students and other young men have filled the streets, openly burning their draft cards and loudly protesting against an administration that, in their opinion, has "destroyed their dreams and replaced them with war". Of course, the opposition has immediately offered support to the protesters, promising their potential voters that their first concern will be the end of this "illiberal and useless measure", which they claim "receives the backing of profiteers and kleptocrats".\n\nSlowly, painfully, the police is restoring control, and the draft has resumed when it became clear that all those who refused to present themselves to the barracks will spend enough time in prison to completely forget about college. Still, it has appeared clear that the escalation of the war is seen with hostility and dissatisfaction by the general population of America, something which should drive the President towards a quick and victorious conclusion of this bloody conflict."

USA.oilcrisis.21.t:0 "Sending off Schwarzkopf"
USA.oilcrisis.21.desc:0 "Colonel Norman Schwarzkopf is one of the best minds we have when it comes to modern warfare. He's studied the examples of our allies and enemies alike, across four continents, and he's published a number of impressive internal memos about the present situation in the Middle East. Someone like him would be invaluable on the ground during the present crisis, especially to help train and guide the freedom fighters of the Arab world. However, we're in a bit of a bind. There are a number of high-priority conflicts currently raging in the Middle East, and only one Colonel Schwarzkopf. Some in the Pentagon have proposed that he lead a small mission to the Baathist fighters in Egypt, to aid in their struggle against the Saudi-backed theocrats and Italian Empire alike. Having a friend near the Suez Canal wouldn't be a bad idea. At the same time, his efforts could also bear fruit in Syria's current independence struggle, especially with the country's oil fields and strategic location. So, where should we send Colonel Schwarzkopf?"
USA.oilcrisis.21.a:0 "Let's send some soldiers to Syria."
USA.oilcrisis.21.b:0 "With Norman's help, they'll be in Cairo by Christmas!"
USA.oilcrisis.21.c:0 "Neither Syria or Egypt exist"
USA.oilcrisis.22.t:0 "An Arrival in Hama"
USA.oilcrisis.22.desc:0 "An unmarked Learjet aircraft, flown by Air Force pilots in civilian clothes. Its itinerary: Hanscom Air Force Base to Keflavik. Keflavik to Stockholm. And after a long, seatrest-gripping flight over warzones and the anti-aircraft guns of a dozen factions, Stockholm to Hama.\n\nHama was a beautiful, ancient city, tightly clustered along the Orontes River. Minarets and clock towers pierced the skyline, gardens bloomed among its marble ruins, and giant metal water wheels still turned with the river's flow. But Hama was also at war. Flying in low over the Ghab Plain, the pilots could see all the signs. Gun emplacements, burned farms, bombed-out villages who'd had the rotten luck to meet the Turkish Army on a bad day. Or maybe it had been the Baathists who'd done that. "Doesn't matter either way," thought the copilot. He'd seen the same stuff in Namibia.\n\nFinally, the plane touched down at Hama Airbase. The airstrip was little more than packed dirt, and one of the three steel hangars had been demolished by artillery. Out on the "tarmac", the general was waiting. Mohammed Ziad al-Hariri was stout, with a receding hairline and an easy smile. He deployed it as Colonel Schwarzkopf stepped out of the plane. Their respective translators sidled up.\n\n"They call you the New Lafayette, Colonel."\n\n"Technically, I suppose that I would be the New von Steuben."\n\n"Regardless, a free nation thanks you. Welcome to Syria, Colonel Schwarzkopf.""
USA.oilcrisis.22.a:0 ""Liberty will never more be without an asylum.""
USA.oilcrisis.23.t:0 "An Arrival in Beni Suef"
USA.oilcrisis.23.desc:0 "Few people outside of Egypt had ever heard of Beni Suef. The vast streams of capital that had been flooding into Cairo and the Canal, propelled by foreign investment and railroad development, had left it behind. There had been a small Italian garrison-currently smeared across a back alley, courtesy of Baathist bullets-and a train station that most trains never bothered to stop at. It wasn't a true backwater, and to villagers throughout the governorate, it was still "el-madina", but most residents could feel the malaise in the air.\n\nNobody aboard the unmarked Learjet, cutting through the chilly night, knew about this. As it touched down on the makeshift airstrip, set up on the other side of the Nile from Beni Suef, a cadre of Baathist officers stood at attention. A small group of American soldiers hustled down the airstair, followed by the man of the hour. Deep-set eyes, a vast American chin, and a colonel's eagle on his uniform. Norman Schwarzkopf looked back at the plane that had brought him to Egypt, and then to the Egyptian officers.\n\n"Salaam aleikum.""

USA_a_new_republic_desc:0 "The Middle East has found itself plunged into crisis and disorder. On the one hand, Saudi Arabia is attempting to push its influence with guns and cash for radical Islamists. On the other hand, the Italian Empire seeks to hold onto its power in the region, for its imperial prestige and ENI profits. But, at the same time, both have found themselves struggling against the nascent forces of Arab republicanism. From Yemen to Syria to Egypt, army officers and ideologues alike are taking up arms in defense of national sovereignty, and against the despots of the past. We should throw our support behind these brave souls, and ensure that the Middle East is independent and free for all.\n\nAnd, as a bonus, victory will bring with it access to the world's greatest reserves of oil."
USA_There_Will_Be_Blood_desc:0 "Collaboration with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia might present itself as a lucrative option, but it is one with the potential for unknown blowback and unforeseen consequences. Instead, we should exercise our own influence in the Middle East, disrupting the Italians and standing against the Saudis. To do this, we should support the rebels that, across the Arab world, have taken up arms in the name of freedom. It is vital that we support them against the tide of Saudi and Italian bullets. Yes, the outcome may be violent, but the established hegemons in the Middle East will be beaten by our proxies and cowed by our resolve. Such an effort would be well worth it."
USA_Make_Ready_For_War_desc:0 "Diplomatic communiques alone won't help our allies in the Middle East. If we're going to help liberate the nations of the Arab world, we'll have to send some firepower their way. We can send out new, discreet contracts to our top arms suppliers-Colt, Lockheed, Remington-and let them know that there will be more work on the way. These new arms shipments won't be anything fancy, but they will demonstrate our commitment to our Arab allies, while also giving American manufacturing a needed boost. Everybody wins!"
USA_A_New_Lafayette_desc:0 "The conflicts of the past several decades have produced a new crop of skilled officers and theoreticians. One of the most well-known of these, especially among the ranks of the Army, is Colonel Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. Colonel Schwarzkopf is a student of guerrilla tactics and resistance movements, and is well-positioned to help the nascent rebellions that have sprung up across the Middle East. He's one of our top men, and sending him into the field would undoubtedly boost our allies' efforts significantly. Nearly two centuries ago, a young Frenchman named Gilbert du Motier sailed to America, to help liberate our young nation. Colonel Schwarzkopf, one might say, is our answer to his legacy."
USA_Assess_Their_Politics_desc:0 "If truth is the first casualty of war, then democracy may be the second. Many of our new allies, whether rebel armies or nascent states, tend not to be particularly free or open. Military strongmen dominate governments, while militias act... rashly, shall we say, towards civilian populations. For the most part, this is acceptable. There is a war to be won, after all, and not all niceties can be preserved. At the same time, though, we are the Organization of FREE Nations. Moreover, our arms shipments and diplomatic cover are in large part responsible for the survival of these forces. We can certainly stand to assess the internal politics of our allies, and try and push them towards a more pluralistic form of government. Why else are we here, if not to push freedom's power ever further?"
USA_Just_Like_Nambia_desc:0 "The South African War was fought on many fronts, from the marshes of the Limpopo to the mountains of the Manica, but one of the most infamous was certainly the deserts of southerwestern Africa. Amid the sands of the Namib, the Moçâmedes, and the Kalahari, American officers learned many lessons about desert warfare. Now, with our new intervention in the Middle East, we have the opportunity to put those lessons to good use. New "advisor" units, veterans of South Africa all, can integrate near-seamlessly into the forces of our Middle Eastern allies. With the knowledge of battles past, we can reap new victories in the fights to come."
USA_Spread_The_Cash_desc:0 "Money is a very effective tool. It can garner influence, fame, and resources, almost without limit. And, fortunately, the United States has plenty of money to move around. Our extensive discretionary cash reserves can be used to purchase loyalties across the Middle East, along with the services of armed contractors from further afield. In the grand scheme of things, it's fairly cheap, with the potential for major benefits. The efforts of these soldiers of fortune could go a long way towards achieving victory for our allies."
USA_Merchants_of_Death_desc:0 "Diplomatic support is a welcome boost for our allies. Money, advisors, and even foreign mercenaries are even more welcome. But at the end of the day, wars are won with firepower, and while our hands are officially tied by the bonds of congressional oversight, the CIA has a wealth of experience with ensuring that guns get where they're needed. Embargo, emshmargo. Our allies will get all the weaponry and ammunition they need, and both the Arabs and our own geopolitical position will benefit. And if some of those guns help to secure oil fields, well, so much the better."
USA_Across_The_Burning_Sands_desc:0 "America's presence in the Middle East has certainly ramped up over the past several months, but by comparison to the Italians and Saudis, it's still fairly paltry. That must change. We must send new, large-scale contingents of "military advisors" to support our allies in their fights against fascism and Islamism. On the ground, our firepower, tactics, and good old-fashioned American tenacity will surely demolish the enemy proxies. Our intervention will be felt from Riyadh to Rome, and beyond. There is a strong will for democracy in the Arab world, and America will ensure its security, by any means necessary."
USA_Smother_the_Flames_desc:0 "Collaboration with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia might present itself as a lucrative option, but it is one with the potential for unknown blowback and unforeseen consequences. Instead, we should exercise our own influence in the Middle East, disrupting the Italians and standing against the Saudis. To do this, we should work on winning hearts, minds, and wallets across the region. Independence movements will be supported, victimized populations will be assisted, and new, strong, and free nations will be supported in the Arab world. Their prosperity, and their stability, will be our gain."
USA_Stabilize_the_Situation_desc:0 "Our allies in the Arab world need all the help that we can provide. That much is certain. However, the niceties of congressional oversight and the proclivities of public opinion make any offer of direct military aid all but impossible. That doesn't mean that we can't assist them, though. Shipments of non-lethal equipment such as binoculars, camouflage, vehicles, and body armor should be one of our top priorities. In addition, food and medical supplies can benefit both our allies' forces on the ground AND the civilians who have been put in harm's way by the fighting. Such efforts will communicate our commitments in the Middle East, while also earning some positive news coverage. After all, we're sending them butter, not guns. Who could have a problem with that?"
USA_Operation_Desert_Shield_desc:0 "Throughout the bloody wars that have torn the Middle East apart, one constant has been the use of air power by outside powers, seeking to bolster their proxies in the Arab world. Such air power has given them an advantage, but it's also had disastrous consequences for civilians on the ground. No longer. Using aircraft carriers stationed in the Indian Ocean, we can declare a series of no-fly zones over conflict areas. It will certainly be a slap in the face to powers like Italy, who have enjoyed years of uninterrupted hegemony in Arab skies, but countless lives will be saved, and American prestige will surely be bolstered."
USA_Help_The_Refugees_desc:0 "From Syria to Yemen to Egypt, and beyond, tens of thousands of civilians have been forced from their homes. Whether it's from the countryside to cities, from province to province, or from country to country, there are massive populations of displaced innocents who are in desperate need of assistance. The United States is in an excellent position to provide that assistance. Our freighters and transport planes can be tasked to send civilian medical teams, food aid, and even creature comforts to the refugee camps that are springing up across the region. It's the right thing to do, and more importantly, it will produce a tsunami of positive PR for our involvement in the Middle East."
USA_Guns_For_Democracy_desc:0 "If truth is the first casualty of war, then democracy may be the second. Many of our new allies, whether rebel armies or nascent states, tend not to be particularly free or open. Military strongmen dominate governments, while militias act... rashly, shall we say, towards civilian populations. We can do better. Our unique position, as their primary source of supplies and diplomatic backing, gives us a great deal of leverage. We can hold the carrot of renewed aid, in return for liberalization of governance and accountability for abuses by military forces. It wouldn't need to be substantial, as long as it was public. If not, there's always the threat of being left out in the cold. That would be the stick."
USA_The_Desert_Scouts_desc:0 "The violence that the people of the Arab world have been facing as of late is intolerable. While our air interdiction efforts and humanitarian aid have certainly born fruit, we need to work further to stabilize the Middle East. One new proposal is to use American helicopters as a way to patrol far inland, when regular airpower would be imprecise or insufficient. Helicopters are generally much more versatile, and can be used to transport everything from medicine to information to tactical units. Such a "desert scout" program would initially consist mainly of American "blue suits", but with a bit of time, we can train our allies to fly as well. These patrols would undoubtedly yield excellent results on the ground."
USA_The_Hand_of_Kindness_desc:0 "War is hell, and war is destructive. While many states in the Middle East had already been struggling with developing modern infrastructure commensurate to their roles in the global economy, these recent wars have only made the issue worse. This is an issue that we can address. American investment, materiel, and engineering expertise can pave new highways, build new bridges, and upgrade rail lines in territories controlled by our allies. This will improve our ties, but in a region gripped by war, such programs would also provide a measure of stability."
USA_Sending_Them_Experts_desc:0 "Another one of war's casualties, too often, is knowledge. The Middle East has experienced a continual brain drain over the past several decades, as fascist colonialism and destabilizing wars have ruined the academic talent pools of the Arab world. By offering new scholarships to students from allied nations, and investing in research institutions, we can help ensure that the lands which gave us the House of Wisdom retain their intellectual strength. To secure the future, we must teach the present."
USA_A_More_Direct_Approach_desc:0 "At the end of the day, America is involved in the Middle East. Our officers help train forces in Egypt, our cargo planes supply refugees in Syria, and our cruise missiles protect the cities and towns of Yemen. We cannot ignore it, and as these wars against fascism and Wahabism continue to exact a bloody toll on the Arab world, it is clear that placing some boots on the ground is necessary. It will likely result in some protest at home, in the papers and in the streets of Washington, but America's regional interests are on the line, and American prestige must be preserved.\n\nJust so long as we can devise an exit strategy."

The American people have elected President [Root.GetLeader] in large part to bring them home posthaste.\n\nCongress has split into two sides over when to pull our boys out of the Veld. The "Interventionists", led by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, argue that bringing more of them for large-scale offensives will finally break the Schild's back and end the war soon. Chairman of House Foreign Relations Donald Rumsfeld and his "Technocrats" advocate leaving only our best behind with better leadership, doctrines, weapons systems and intelligence instead of risking a gruesome war of attrition.\n\nWhoseever advise the President listens to shall become America's strategy going forward.

Thus, the Pentagon has proposed the Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support Program, aka CORDS. By assigning training personnel and funding to local communities, we can build up local security forces. This will give us additional cachet on the ground, and additional manpower to help combat a variety of insurgents.

As expected of Ford's brightest Whiz Kid, in hindsight. Perhaps he viewed the conflict as a car plant with faults to solve, and the men involved no different from spare parts on a manager's requisition list.

His attitude is that victory in South Africa can only be achieved by giving the military the authority to "bomb the Nazis back to the Stone Age".

With our new airpower, though, we can use defoliants and napalm to eliminate all of these potential guerrilla hiding places. It will also have the convenient effect of forcing rural peasants into strategic hamlets and urban areas, denying the enemy a civilian population to hide within.

While Japan seems to be controlled by level-headed men, we must still be careful to toe the fine line between isolationism and being mavericks.\n\nWe will place a call to the Japanese on the red telephone. We will assure them that we have no interest in sending Japanese boys home with American bullets in them. Yet, our commitment to democratic movements around the world brings upon us a moral obligation to support those who fight for freedom in Indonesia. Reminding them of Indonesia's technical independence and sovereignty, we will caution them against launching an intervention into the East Indies and remind them that threatening the freedom of a sovereign people may have dire consequences."

 USA_RD_work_the_backchannels_desc:0 "Open armament of Free Indonesia may be a bridge too far for the moment. Nonetheless, equipment has often found its way into the stockpiles of rebel movements throughout the world. If American equipment were to find itself in Hatta's hands, well, that would surely be just a coincidence...\n\nWe shall open back-channels of communication and transport between Hatta and the United States. We shall ensure Hatta gets his hands on some premium American equipment. Hopefully, this will help turn the tide in the Indonesian war."
 USA_RD_secure_supply_lines_desc:0 "Every army travels on its stomach, and Hatta's is no different. His men need food, his trucks need fuel, and his guns need cartridges. America will gladly provide all of these.\n\nWe will use our positions in the Pacific, particularly Australia, to secure supply lines to the liberated zones of Indonesia. With our help, Hatta's men will want for nothing. We can only hope Japan is less generous to Sukarno than we are to Hatta."
 USA_RD_south_africa_lessons_desc:0 "The conflict in South Africa taught us much about asymmetrical warfare in the late 20th century. Our troops are battle-hardened, and our attaches may have useful insights to offer Hatta's freedom fighters.\n\nWe will send US Army Rangers to teach the Free Indonesians entrenchment tactics to improve their defensive capabilities against Sukarno. We will also teach them logistical techniques that will improve their mobility and ability to stay organized while on the march."
 USA_RD_send_advisers_desc:0 "The war has dragged on longer than we hoped, and we have no choice now but to escalate. Where once, we merely assisted Hatta's army, now it's time to fight alongside them.\n\nWe will send a full division of US troops to Indonesia in an "advisory" role. While these will merely be volunteers, they will be fighting in the thick of it defending the Indonesians on their left and right. This move will allow us to take a more direct role in the Indonesian war effort."
 USA_RD_hidden_hand_desc:0 "Our "advisors" have been making excellent progress in the Indonesian war effort, yet Sukarno's henchmen have proven rather intractable. Perhaps it is time to use our new forward base and naval routes to enlarge our commitment in Indonesia.\n\nAnother division of "advisors" will be deployed to aid Hatta. This will still be done under the guise of volunteer assistance of the Free Indonesian administration, that our "hidden hand" in the conflict may continue to be obscured."
 USA_RD_war_of_words_desc:0 "As the Indonesian conflict unfolds, it is critical that we control the conversation surrounding it. While the American everyman might not have much of a reason to care about Indonesia, by framing the situation as a struggle against our Japanese enemy, we might win their hearts and minds.\n\nWe will hit the airwaves and ensure that the world and our own people both know the righteousness of Hatta's cause. This will induce our people at home to sympathize with the Indonesian struggle for freedom, as well as assure the Free Indonesians that we have their back."
 USA_RD_united_we_stand_desc:0 "The Indonesian War is not a vanity project for the US alone, but a cause the whole OFN can get behind. We can't shoulder the burden of aiding Hatta alone, it's time for the OFN to contribute to the liberation of Indonesia.\n\nWe will call in support from the OFN. Not volunteers, that's a bridge too far, but we will secure substantial equipment donations from our member states. Hatta's men will be armed with weapons from as far afield as Canada and New Zealand. This will hopefully greatly aid their independence struggle."
 USA_RD_expand_the_fleet_desc:0 "In 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry sailed into Tokyo Bay and forced the Japanese to end centuries of isolation from the world. He accomplished this by having a massive armada of the finest warships sailing behind him. Naval intimidation of the Japanese worked once, we pray it shall work again.\n\nWe will start insisting on double shifts at our dockyards. Fleet production will ramp up considerably so that our ships may be commissioned more quickly. Hopefully, we'll be able to spook the Japanese with our resurgent Navy."
 USA_RD_force_their_hand_desc:0 "The Japanese control the Indonesian skies. Sukarno's men fly above and rain hell on Hatta's men below. The Sphere's aerial dominance is unquestioned.\n\nPerhaps it's time to question it.\n\nWe will send fighter jets and CAS equipment to Hatta. He will now be able to boast a powerful air squadron to challenge Japanese air superiority. Of course, this may tip Japan over the edge..."
 USA_RD_arms_production_desc:0 "The Indonesian conflict is more demanding than we realized. Our existing military factory output is insufficient to meet the needs of Hatta's men, as Sukarno has dug in more deeply than we expected.\n\nBut that's easy to solve.\n\nWe will send over engineers to Free Indonesia to construct a major military production complex as swiftly as possible. This will be a small boost to the Free Indonesian arms output, but hopefully enough to turn the tide against Sukarno. "
 USA_RD_forward_base_darwin_desc:0 "Australia is our closest ally to the Indonesians. The Northern tip of the country has one quite populous city, Darwin. This area could serve as an important launch point for any actions taken in the South Pacific.\n\nWe will offer to construct vast fortification networks in Northern Australia in order to brace for the conflict coming to their shores. These bases will also be excellent points from which to deploy troops to Indonesia."
 USA_RD_emergency_naval_training_desc:0 "I don't know if you've ever looked at a map, but there is no land route from the United States to Indonesia. Consequently, the Navy will be essential for any operations to assist Hatta, and it is all too important that the Navy be ready to carry them out.\n\nWe will launch emergency naval exercises to prepare our seamen for Indonesian operations. This may allow us to better update our naval warfare doctrines should we come into any conflict on the open seas. Hopefully the Japanese aren't foolish enough to let things get to that point, but we must nevertheless be prepared."
 USA_RD_ready_the_airforce_desc:0 "Our airmen are eager to deploy into Indonesia, but they need a base to deploy from first. Darwin has already been fortified for defense, but now it must be equipped for aerial operations.\n\nWe will send engineers to Australia to hastily construct air bases that are large enough for sizable air deployments. Their proximity to Indonesia shall allow us to aid Hatta's men from above, and deploy more squadrons than ever before."

 USA_NPP_ready_the_australians_desc:0 "Nixon, coward that he was, envisioned a policy of "containment" of Japanese imperialism. He would have used Australia as a forward operating base for US troops to provide an assistance role to Hatta. But we in the NPP know that the Organization of Free Nations ain't free. The Aussies ain't here to be a mere base of operations, they're going into the breach by our side.\n\nWe will put a call to the Aussies and tell them to ready their men for intervention in Indonesia. We'll get them fired up and ready to run through the jungle. We'll also send them some equipment too, in case they need it."
 USA_NPP_mandatory_naval_training_desc:0 "The purpose of the US Navy isn't just to move troops from point A to point B. It's not just a series of carriers for our planes. No, the Navy is a powerful tool in our diplomatic arsenal. It's the cannon that will fire the Marine Corps at Sukarno and keep the Japanese at arm's length.\n\nWe will conduct emergency Naval exercises to prepare the USN to starve Sukarno. Not only that, we will prepare our ships to deploy our forces on a moment's notice. Sukarno has no idea what he's in for, and the IJN would be well advised to stay out of the South Pacific while we operate..."
 USA_NPP_begin_the_blockade_desc:0 "The American people will not accept another South Africa. They do not want a long, protracted conflict that leads to horrible images on TV. They need not worry, we'll make sure Sukarno doesn't last long enough for us to get sick of fighting him. It's time to starve the beast.\n\nWe will cut Japan off from Indonesia. The USN will surround the East Indies, securing our supply lines and crippling Sukarno's. Our training will go a long way to making our Navy able to win the new Pacific conflict. Our Navy will be on high alert to stop any and all threats to Hatta's liberation struggle."
 USA_NPP_airforce_indonesia_desc:0 "Our naval supremacy in the East Indies has been entrenched through the blockade, but our air supremacy has yet to be established.\n\nYet.\n\nThe USAF will now begin emergency drills in preparation for the East Indies conflict. While on high alert, they will be far more effective at controlling the skies and aiding Hatta's ground troops."
 USA_NPP_south_africa_lessons_desc:0 "The conflict in South Africa taught us much about asymmetrical warfare in the late 20th century. Our troops are battle-hardened, and our attaches may have useful insights to offer Hatta's freedom fighters.\n\nWe will send US Army Rangers to teach the Free Indonesians entrenchment tactics to improve their defensive capabilities against Sukarno. We will also teach them logistical techniques that will improve their mobility and ability to stay organized while on the march."
 USA_NPP_send_over_the_planes_desc:0 "We cannot control the skies alone. Our pilots are still only flying in a volunteer role.

USA_RD_INS.01.d:0 "The East Indies have exploded into civil war as the rivalry between President Sukarno of Indonesia and his opposition, led by Vice President Mohammad Hatta, have finally come to blows. Forces across the archipelago are mobilizing and taking sides, as various army regiments and resistance groups flock to the rebels. Already, protestors in major cities, having been broken up through force of arms, are retreating into the jungles to settle in for the long war.\n\nWhile some may be surprised to see the once-beloved Sukarno the target of a civil war, most expert observers have been anticipating such a conflict for years. Sukarno's increasingly dictatorial sway over Indonesia has soured opinion, both in the government and among the people, to the point where his own Vice President had become the greatest voice against him.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Japanese have declared support for their ally in the dictatorial Sukarno, but Free Indonesia is not without potential allies. Despite consisting mainly of hardline communists and Islamists, the rebellion has attracted much support in America from the anti-Japanese National Progressive Party. With such a vital part of the Co-Prosperity Sphere in flames, the United States stands in a unique position to weaken the Japanese stranglehold over Asia-- something that many Americans have been demanding for decades."

He shuffled around his speech notes as the audience eagerly awaited his words on the Indonesian conflict. This was the opportunity; the first chance America had to break the Japanese stranglehold over Asia. He had better make it count.\n\n"Fellow Americans... over the course of the past several weeks, a conflict of a momentous nature has erupted in the reaches of Southeast Asia-- in the island nation of Indonesia. There, as we speak, thousands of men and women are dying for a most righteous cause: the destruction of tyranny. A dictatorial shadow has encompassed that land, and now, an army of freedom-loving peoples are fighting to burn that shadow away."\n\n"...the cause of the Indonesian freedom fighters is one that America shall always support. As our forefathers fought in the valley of Pennsylvania, so too do their heroes fight in the jungles of Java and of Borneo. These men and women, engaged in such a righteous struggle, must not be allowed to fail. However, with the freedom-loving people of America standing behind them, they shall not. Indonesia shall be a free and democratic nation as God has ordained it to be. Together, the peoples of Indonesia and America shall see that tyranny is extinguished from this Earth!""

This could be a critical opportunity for the United States to gain a new ally against Japanese domination of Asia, as long as we act quickly."

With Sukarno ousted, the popular front of Free Indonesia has taken power. Comprised of anti-Sukarno republicans, oppressed ethnic groups, communists, and Islamists, this ragtag army proved too strong for the loyalist forces. Already, a democratic government is being set up in Jakarta with much of the former rebel leaders taking up leadership positions.\n\nWith the victory of Free Indonesia, the administration of [USA.GetLeader] has seen a notable increase in popular approval. Having promised the defeat of Sukarno and the triumph of democracy, the President's promise appears to have become reality.

From the balcony of a Jakarta government building, Sukarno delivered a speech, declaring the civil war to be finally over. The opposition forces, comprised of republicans, oppressed ethnic groups, communists, and Islamists, are now surrendering to the government in Jakarta en masse. Already, many of the leaders of the rebellion are being rounded up and then executed or sent to prison.\n\nWith the victory of Sukarno, and his autocratic grip over Indonesia tightened, the American public has become angered and distraught. After so many defeats over the past 20 years, it is still disheartening to see another flicker of liberty be extinguished. Most upset are those in the National Progressive Party, who blame Japanese intervention and a limp-wristed American response for the defeat of Free Indonesia. With another American boondoggle in Southeast Asia, it appears the political establishment in Washington may be harder pressed to keep their jobs in the next election."

Now, with the war over, any chance for the administration of [GetLeader] to redeem itself on this issue has passed.\n\nDespite claiming that the United States would support the cause of Free Indonesia against the Japanese-backed Sukarno government, President [USA.GetLeader] appears to have fallen through on his promise. No American support ever reached the anti-Sukarno forces in Indonesia, and many have claimed that the President simply allowed the Japanese to reassert their control over the archipelago.

USA_RD_INS.11.d:0 "There was a small protest along the National Mall today of less than 500 people against the recent deployment of American troops to Indonesia. The archipelago erupted into civil war this year, and the United States has officially intervened on the side of the forces fighting against the regime of President Sukarno. So far, the war has gone relatively well for the United States Marine Corps and Army forces who have been deployed there. There have been no major defeats, and generally, allied forces have been winning more and more victories.\n\nThe protest, largely led by students from Georgetown University and American University, focused on pacifism and the predicted loss of American lives overseas. The march was widely panned, particularly by Senator Strom Thurmond as "a bunch of youngsters who have no idea what they're talking about". Despite the political criticism, experts agree that sentiments expressed in the march are not exclusive to young college students, and that small-scale opposition to the Indonesian War may be seen across the country in coming months."

USA_RD_INS.12.d:0 "Today, at the University of California, Berkeley, a protest against the Indonesian War turned violent as clashes between National Guard and police forces monitoring the march and the demonstrators themselves. One Berkeley student, whose name is unknown at this time, apparently threw a brick at a National Guardsman in full riot-gear. The brick missed, but still had an impact, as the National Guard raised their weapons and began firing rubber bullets and tear gas into the mass of students and protestors.\n\nBy the time the protest had been dispersed, more than 20 people had been hospitalized for injuries. Most unfortunately, however, was the case of student James Rector, who was shot with live ammunition by police and killed during the fighting. The violence has had a widely polarizing effect on the United States as a whole, with many calling the protestors thugs, and others calling them heroes. It also highlights the increasing unpopularity of the war in Indonesia and America's involvement in it."

USA_RD_INS.13.t:0 "Burning Pacifism"
USA_RD_INS.13.d:0 "Today, outside the gates of the White House, a pacifist quaker named Norman Morrison doused himself with gasoline and set himself on fire. The man appears to not have screamed almost at all, despite the extreme pain, which suggested to investigators some kind of pain killing drug use. After all that remained was a charred corpse, however, the man's child, Emily, was found, with a note describing his reasons for suicide. He wrote that he had done this in protest to President [USA.GetLeader]'s involvement in the Indonesian Civil War, and that he set himself on fire in solidarity with the Indonesian and American boys who didn't choose a death by fire.\n\nThe public and political reaction can be described as nothing short of horrified. Thousands of people are now planning to "March for Morrison" and spread the ideas that he killed himself for. The President has yet to comment on the issue, but the White House is not letting in press at the moment.\n\nMorrison's death and the vast sympathy to it across the country appears to be part of a growing trend of Americans disliking the country's involvement in the Indonesian Civil War. While there is still a great number who call the anti-war demonstrators "traitors", more and more Americans say that the war is costing too much for too little. Whether or not the government will do anything remains to be seen, but if the anti-war movement has a dedication like Morrison's, it's unlikely that the government will have a choice."

USA_RD_INS.14.t:0 "America on Fire"
USA_RD_INS.14.d:0 "Over the past few days, many cities across the continental United States have erupted into violence following a massive series of organized and unorganized protests against the country. The demonstrations were meant to be against the widely-hated American intervention in the Indonesian Civil War, which has seen little returns for a great cost of lives. Reports claim that in many cities, violence was started by police told to disperse the protestors by any means necessary; in others, it appears protestors heard of violence in other cities and/or simply decided to start some themselves.\n\nThe violence is now beginning to calm down, and the cost appears to be astronomical. More than 50 Americans lay dead, all across the country, and hundreds or thousands have been hospitalized from wounds. It is evident from the sheer scale of the riots that the nation as a whole despises the war in Indonesia, and desires a complete end to the conflict."

"A decade or so since Eisenhower tore up the Akagi Accords and admitted Hawaii to the Union. Now it's our turn to finish what he started."\n\nThe proposal - to stand up to Japan at last and to demand negotiations over the Treaty Ports of San Francisco and Los Angeles - would be the most ambitious and consequential diplomatic initiative by the United States in their lifetimes. The eyes of the world, and of the American electorate, would be scrutinizing them under a microscope. There would be no room for failure.\n\nThe Japanese wouldn't simply fold - but it was clear that holding ports halfway across the world, a diplomatic nightmare and impossible to secure, was increasingly unattractive.\n\nHow much could America push, without being pushed aside by Japan in return? It would take the political power of the American government to ensure the successful return of the ports, without giving away the house to the Japanese in the process - but a few concessions here and there might be useful in making demands further down the line..."

Twenty years after the victory in the Pacific, the ports were rapidly becoming more trouble than they were worth as Japan faced new challenges from every corner. If Japan could walk away from the negotiations with tangible guarantees - open trade, oil provisions, or an enforceable promise to formally recognize Japan's suzerainty over the Sphere - then what were two ports, really?\n\nIt would take every ounce of political and diplomatic capital to keep any deal as favorable to Japan as possible, even if they gave way on certain items to gain a temporary advantage to be used later.

One big problem between our nation and the Co-Prosperity Sphere is the fact that we do not trade enough. Because of this, the Japanese have demanded substantial amounts of oil to make up for their recent shortages. Simply put, the Sphere lacks many of the oil reserves that we have here in the United States. Luckily, the Japanese diplomats seem pretty desperate to sign a contract with us. If we grant them subsidized oil purchases, the economy of the Sphere will continue functioning and we may regain our lost ports. If we help out the Japanese and the Sphere helps us out, we could see a brighter relationship between our two great nations. We also have a chance of bringing American workers back to work for us.\n\nNow, the question of the moment is: how much oil will we give to the Empire of Japan? We could be generous and offer them the substantial amounts of oil they say they need. We could go down the middle and offer them a moderate amount of oil. Finally, we could give them small amounts of oil, but they may not accept the offer. We also need to consider what the Japanese plan to use the oil for. What do you say, Mr. President?"

These negotiations were not just for the goodness of the peoples of San Francisco and Los Angeles, no, the Americans were going to gain much-needed prestige from the deal with Japan.\n\nThe Japanese, on the other hand, were handling a massive oil shortage across the Co-Prosperity Sphere.

Wasn't this the problem that caused World War II in the first place? But they were desperate. Desperate for a resource that would fix the economic problems of an entire region. The negotiations showed that apparently, Japan was not desperate enough. And now, the oil crisis continues to strangle the Empire of Japan's economy, and the military-industrial complex is on the worst end of the situation.\n\nThe negotiations carry on, but the trade deal has been terminated."

No matter what, both parties hope that these negotiations will better relations between the two global superpowers. Workers both in California and the Japanese Home Islands rejoiced as the nations announced the completion of the deal.\n\nThough the trade deal was completed, the diplomats of the United States and Japan still have work to do.

The greediness of the Japanese diplomats is utterly atrocious, and it is causing many of us to lose faith in this deal. My colleagues and I have asked ourselves, "Is it even worth it to trade massive amounts of oil for two ports?"\n\nWe're faced with two more options, Mr. President. We can either continue persuading the Japanese that our original offer is enough, or we can submit to the Empire's request. No matter the decision, we need to make sure this offer is in our favor."

The Americans never considered anyone but themselves anyway; it's a miracle they were able to return to the world stage with this lack of decency.\n\nBut they are ultimately too persistent and too blind to continue these talks further.

This would ensure us the most important prize, market access, and allow us to quickly move on to other parts of the treaty.\n\nMany in our cabinets, however, believe that a mutual lift favors the Americans too much, and are pushing to attach trade conditions to the deal. These conditions would provide for mutual reduction of several tariffs in areas beneficial to Japan, ensuring us more favorable trade terms, but might not go down well with the Americans.\n\nThirdly, there are some who think we are offering a deal too cheaply, inviting further bullying attempts by the Americans in the future. This outspoken group demands we attach a hefty price tag to the transfer of the Treaty Ports, and makes this a condition to resume trade.

Access to the vast markets in Japan, China and India, and raw materials from the rest of the sphere, is too big a prize to risk by adding clauses and conditions to the treaty.\n\nSome of our more hawkish negotiators, however, suggest we should push for more. They say the conditions of trade in the sphere is set up to favor Japan, and we should ensure a deal that puts us on a more equal footing.

We can pay directly for the ports to be returned and not have to worry about paying subsidies to Japan. Alternatively, we could just end the meeting here and not give the Japanese anything.

The specifics of the transfer has been left to the end of the negotiations, and this will be the last clause up for discussion. We have a few options for how we position ourselves to approach these final negotiations.\n\nOur advisors fear that a straightforward transfer will be perceived in Japan as a loss of face, and that the politics of that perception might jeopardize the negotiations. To avoid this, they say, we should offer to demilitarize the ports upon transfer. By doing so we will ensure the Japanese have something they can point to as "getting in return" - enabling them to transfer the ports without appearing weak.\n\nOthers in our administration counsel a tougher approach. The goal of the whole summit, they say, is to turn a page on our relations with Japan, and that can only be accomplished if they agree not only to the port transfer, but to demilitarize Hawaii. With the Hawaiian Missile Crisis in all too recent memory, they claim the asymmetry of mutual threat will soon cause a rise in tensions back to previous levels as long as the Japanese garrison the island chain. Our most hawkish counsel suggests we can demand the demilitarization of Hawaii without offering to demilitarize the ports in turn. According to them, it's the only solution the man in the street will accept, and thus the only way to prevent future resentment from souring relations.\n\nWhat approach should we choose?"

The American delegation has opened the negotiations by sending a proposal for a conditional transfer where they pledge themselves to demilitarize the ports for the rest of the treaty period if we allow the transfer to go ahead. Most of our advisors consider this a favorable deal. It accomplishes our main objectives of offloading the diplomatically burdensome ports and improving relations with the USA, while scoring us a victory in the form of demilitarization.\n\nSome, however, are saying that American willingness to accept such conditions betray the weakness of their position, and suggest we push to attach a second condition to the transfer - making the ports a special customs territory shared between our two nations. This will secure our traders and merchant fleets valuable bases of operations for their future American endeavors. It will also, however, provide ample opportunities for smugglers and will almost certainly be considered as onerous and unreasonable by the Americans.\n\nWhat should we tell their delegation?"

If the purpose of the port transfer is to reobtain control over the ports, then accepting the "joint customs zone" defeats that purpose, allowing the Japanese to continue to have a say in the comings and goings of goods through the ports. We'd also open ourselves up to potential smuggling operations out of the zones. Accepting such a blatant power-grab would also encourage Japan to continue this "bad-faith" approach in future talks between our countries, according to these advisors.\n\nOn the other hand, this could be the final hurdle of the negotiations. Paying this price, however unreasonable we find it, will secure the port transfer. That might just be worth swallowing our pride. What should we do?"

Predictably, there are a few voices that speak in opposition, emphasizing the necessity of maintaining national pride and a projection of strength, and demanding we secure compensation for the ports that "match the value of the blood spent" in securing them.\n\nHowever we respond, there's no further room for negotiation, so we should choose our reply carefully."

With the Missile Crisis in recent memory, they claim our forces on the island chain imply a threat to their country, which must be removed for normal relations to resume.\n\nAgreeing to this proposal will accomplish our main objectives of offloading the diplomatically burdensome ports and improving relations with the USA. According to our advisors, however, it is far from balanced. The docks in Hawaii are vital for our operational capacity in the East Pacific. Losing them will force us to choose between reduced operational space, which will surely anger our admirals, or constructing new docks on different islands, which will be expensive. The Americans have already more than replaced the docking capacity they lost when we occupied the ports, and are in no great need of them for their navies.\n\nSome in our delegation point out that while this particular clause may be unbalanced, we risk losing our gains in the earlier clauses should we push the Americans too hard on this issue.

Discussions are completed on the clauses that matter to the Japanese, so they've reverted to their attitude of "victorious conquerors", dictating demands to a vanquished foe. If we accept their diktats, they say, we'll set up for them to continue their arrogant disregard for our interests in our future dealings as well.\n\nOn the other hand, the success of the summit hinges on us finding some way to accommodate both nations here, and we might need to give them this to prevent the negotiations from unraveling entirely.

For any deal to be signed, they say, it must mean the end of Japan dictating matters on US soil, and a demilitarization in California would stand in the way of that aim.\n\nTheir demands are outrageous, far exceeding the scope of what was agreed upon in the lead-up to the summit, and very few would fault us for declining.

Our delegation has remarked on the surprising willingness on the side of Japan to discuss territorial revision and find a compromise in the East Pacific. Together, this provides us with an opportunity too good to pass up. With most of the treaty safely agreed upon, it's time to open discussion on one last question: The return of Hawaii.\n\nIn order to get them to even consider the transfer, we must be prepared to give important concessions in return. Our advisors believe they might ask for a joint or neutral administration of the Panama Canal, extensive arms limitation concessions, or both. Regardless, it might be a price we should be willing to pay. Securing Hawaii would be a fantastic achievement for our government and for the USA, but beyond that, it would cement this treaty as the end of the era of hostility between us and the Japanese.\n\nThe last core US territory still occupied by Japan, its return will mark a true end to the war in the minds of the public and help usher a time of peace in the East Pacific."

For the first short leg of its journey back to friendlier waters, each and every Japanese ship has been sneered farewell by jeers, threats and obscene gestures from a hostile city.\n\nToday, as the last Japanese cruiser finally left the port of San Francisco, this ritual was broken. The jubilant crowds, freshly arrived from "port parties" all over the city, waved and cheered our sailors a final goodbye. The Captain of Chikuma called for all hands on deck to witness the event, and soon our sailors were cheering and waving back. Pictures of the exchange are making the rounds on television on both sides of the Pacific, a sure sign to our people that an era of heightened hostility is coming to a close.\n\nNot everyone is equally enthused, of course. Many in our own country are grumbling about how much ground we are giving to the Americans. We can only hope that the economic benefits of the accords will change their minds as they start trickling out to the population. To the sailors on Chikuma and to many watching at home, it feels like the start of something new."

A tension that has been felt by our people for over twenty years has been finally loosening its grip.\n\nToday, as the treaty ports in Los Angeles and San Francisco passed back to American hands, the atmosphere shifted to one of celebration. All across the country, everyday life has given way to "port parties", pulling whole neighbourhoods out into the streets in celebration. The biggest crowds of all have been seen in the treaty port cities themselves. In San Francisco, cheers from the gathered throngs drowned out the voices of the Japanese ambassador and his translator as the last Japanese flag was taken down and the stars and stripes hoisted in its place.\n\nSurprise was evident among the Japanese as well, as the sailors aboard Chikuma found themselves cheered goodbye by the jubilant crowds, the scowls and jeers they had come to expect from Americans replaced by cheerful smiles and waves. Pictures of the uniformed Japanese smiling and waving back to the crowds are now making the rounds on television on both sides of the Pacific.\n\nTruly, it feels like a page has been turned on US-Japanese relations."

The visit's official intent was a tour around the American capital - a show of goodwill capitalizing on the momentum of the now-named Handover's success.\n\nUnofficially... well, the old man had his suspicions. He thought them confirmed when he entered the Oval Office and saw the President, back turned, inspecting a large canvas map of Hawai'i. The Minister drew in a sharp breath as he took a seat, steeling himself for the last conversation he ever wished to confront in his career.\n\n"I trust the accommodations here are to your liking?" President [GetPresidentLastName] asked without glancing back. The Foreign Minister grunted in assent. Not exactly proper decorum, but he figured the silence meant the President didn't care.\n\n"Good." Leather shoes clacked with polished linoleum as the President shuffled back to the Resolute Desk, pulling several folders out of its cabinet. [USA.GetSheHeCap] spread the stack across the surface like a dealer with a stack of cards. Each folder bore "PROPOSAL" in red capital letters across their tab. "Wouldn't want to keep you from seeing the sights, so I'll keep this brief: we've some ideas for your government's consideration. We'll discuss these more later during your stay."\n\nAs quickly as he had arrived, the Minister left the Office escorted by his assigned guide.

I have indeed received demands, albeit of a comparatively benign nature than both our expectations.\n\n"To summarize: the United States government formally requests a demilitarization zone established in the islands of Hawai'i and the waters 24 nautical miles beyond their shorelines. In exchange, they have agreed to enforce the same in the Panama Canal Zone. President [USA.GetLeader] expects a speedy response in official channels, and has voiced his willingness to attend another conference to negotiate the agreement's finer details at a time and place of our choosing.\n\n"I understand your concerns, sir. Convincing the public, no less the Navy, to return our farthest-flung awards from the Liberation War was already a momentous endeavor by itself. Another concession to our adversary may signal weakness our enemies in Tokyo will doubtless capitalize. Nevertheless, the American President has offered us an opportunity whose waste we can scarce afford: a guarantee of peace between our two nations at least within our lifetimes.

I managed to deflect the advances made as best as one could in my situation, though I can't say the same for the mob that trailed our entourage as we toured Washington D.C. The gold eagle lapel pins several sported made their collusion all too blatant.\n\n"If I may speak my mind for a brief moment: we underestimate the lengths the Americans will go to wrest the islands from us. Nevermind the Navy's tarnished pride, or the Diet's gnashing of teeth; both pale before the conflict our rival is willing to wage over Hawai'i.

Me and my aides-de-camp were invited, which we graciously accepted. What followed was a lengthy tour of the Panama Canal Zone - all of the engineering marvel's fifty miles of length and ten miles of width, and its facilities, traversed in less than a day. It was only when we dined at the Palacio de las Garcias that the President engaged my queries regarding our trip to an American military installation. The response I received went thus: "We can make it yours, but only if you can make one of yours ours again."\n\n"Frankly speaking, Mr. Prime Minister, we would be fools not to engage with the trade. Besides dog-headed sentimentality over their spoils from the Liberation War, the Navy's other rationale behind Port Yamamoto was that it consolidates our hold over the Pacific Ocean with its bases and strategic location. The Panama Canal offers those in addition to uncontested control over one of the world's busiest shipping routes, notwithstanding the estimated $70 million in revenue it generates every year.\n\n"I sincerely believe the Americans have offered us this exchange only because of the goodwill we've garnered from the Handover.

Both parties agreed that lasting peace necessitated the complete absence of military installations and units - troops, planes, ships and missiles - in, above, and about the Hawai'ian Islands and the Panama Canal Zone. Both parties resolved to forbid all military assets from fortifying, basing or, in the case of planes, overflying the aforementioned territories. Both parties also consented to regular inspections by a bipartisan committee, ensuring the agreement's letter and spirit are enforced.\n\nWhere an otherwise ideal negotiation process met the realities of jockeying with a geopolitical adversary was when the frequency of such inspections was broached. Our diplomats, understandably, proposed that the committee convene in an annual basis. The Americans insisted that they convene once every two years instead, stating that sufficiently rigorous inspections for two distinct locations require more time to conduct and report than a year allots. The Japanese delegation's head responded by questioning the need for inspections lasting longer than a year. Their Western adversary's insistence was unperturbed by the dismissal.\n\nAfter several hours of debate (and several emptied bottles of hard liquor), the conference's attendants finally reached a consensus. Henceforth, a committee consisting of select officials and experts from both countries shall inspect Hawai'i and the Panama Canal Zone for breaches of terms..."

"Laws are toothless without punishments," said the Japanese Foreign Minister, "and only sharp teeth suffice for treaties between two nations that can end the world with a button press."\n\nOur ambassadors were split on the issue. On one hand, clearly defined punishments for violations within the proposed DMZs disincentivize Japan from using them as de facto outposts for their Pacific-wide cordon sanitaire - provided, of course, that the same penalties apply to them. Those disinclined to trust the Empire's intentions argued that the punishments will be selectively, and aggressively, applied at our disfavor. (Additionally, a minority opined, stringent punishments will prevent us from justifying certain activities through "creative interpretation" of the agreement's terms. Future administrations may find themselves an option short should the need for action in the DMZs arise.)\n\nIn the end, the American delegation..."

The final point of contention between both parties was how severe the consequences should be. Less fortuitously, fraying tempers skirted the breaking point at this juncture.\n\nThe last stretch between the negotiations and a lasting peace deal began with our fatigued delegation suggesting "harsh punitive measures" against the reneging country. When asked to clarify by the cautious Americans, they proposed actions ranging from remilitarizing the affected territories to establishing a full embargo. Even talk of declaring the Handover null and void gained traction among its more zealous members - that is, until their arguments were cut short by the meaty thwack of a face meeting fist.\n\nOrder returned to the conference room before the negotiations broke down under an inter-Pacific exchange of blunt force trauma. The Americans, now made both cautious and disheveled, presented their own counteroffer: economic sanctions and immediate withdrawal from all economic, military, and diplomatic agreements signed following the Handover. These will be resumed, they further explain, only when the offending party ceases their violations of the agreement. Efforts to extract more from the delegation was met with the enthusiasm of a stony brick wall.\n\nAs a new day peeked from the window blinders, Japan's diplomats reached their ultimate consensus:"

Less ornaments than his own and maybe several years more worn, but a wedding ring all the same.\n\nHe glanced at the conference room. Or what was a conference room. Shredded and whole paper covered every square inch of floorboard, topped by stray mug shards slick with drying pools of coffee and the stray blood smear. Its occupants fared little better; either they were dozing off where they stood or sat or laid, wincing at cuts and bruises covered in flimsy gauze pads, or both. 24 straight hours of wheeling and dealing a treaty had taken its toll. No doubt the Japanese were eager to leave with what they had, at least then they'll enjoy sleeping in cushions and for more than a few hours in the flight home.\n\nCan he say the same for his - that they were satisfied with what they had? Will his countrymen approve what he'd wrangled from the Empire when all's said and done? Or will both dig their heels and ask for more?\n\nThe Secretary then turned to the man with the outstretched hand, opposite his side of the long table. Stodgy with a bald spot, purple bags for eyes, a rotund belly protruding from an unbuttoned suit. He might as well have been a middle-aged salaryman coming home from overtime, rather than the Empire's premier representative abroad. Yet his tired smile and open palm seemed to offer a hope just as mundane: peace from across the aisle. The first in a very long time.\n\nNodding to himself, the Secretary of State..."

Putting paid to America's pretensions, if it protected the Empire's good faith from further abuse, certainly allured to him.\n\nBut he had his Minister's personal appeal to consider. Washington's erratic gestures might simply be a bluff of some sort, the man argued. The closest the Pacific ever has been to certain peace lay just beyond the Empire's fingertips, and will be theirs should it choose to reach out instead of reflexively withdrawing from an impermanent slight.

USA_the_iranian_civil_war_desc:0 "War grips Iran, one of the few countries in the Muslim world with a strong tradition for democracy. If we are serious about our commitment to ensuring fascism is contained everywhere in the world, we must be as forceful and determined in our response to this civil war as we are in countries like South Africa and Indonesia. The US has always been and will always remain a steadfast ally of antifascists everywhere, and America has always been a true friend of Iran. We must look to organizing a response, we cannot let the fascists control the oil reserves there to fuel their evil empires."
USA_iranian_aid_bill_desc:0 "The House foreign policy committee has swiftly drawn up a bill authorizing dispatch of advisors, equipment and financial aid to Iran, as well as authorizing the government to advertise, organize and dispatch volunteer divisions from both veteran and active duty Army personnel. Once this goes through Congress, help will be on its way to the brave Iranians."
USA_american_aid_inbound_desc:0 "The Iranian Aid Act has been quickly rushed through Congress to ensure a timely response to the crisis there. An immediate loan of $100 million has been granted to the Iranian liberal faction so they can fund their armed forces until American equipment and volunteers can arrive en masse. Initial military advisors are to be dispatched as soon as secure flights can be established, followed by the equipment and then the volunteers. With some luck the Iranian liberal movement will soon be strong and economically stable, a force that can sweep aside the armies of tyranny opposing them."
USA_american_equipment_desc:0 "Coordinating with the Iranian liberals and our advisors, we have set up a pipeline for regular shipments of military equipment between California and Iran, using Australia as a go-between. Sadly, for the moments this limits our ability to send significant quantities for the gear, but the ability for the Iranians to use the remaining money from their loan to buy American weaponry and gear will certainly be a relief for both them and our domestic arms industry."
USA_american_military_advisors_desc:0 "The eagle soars once again to distant shores! Our advisor teams report the bulk of their teams have landed safely in Iran, and request we coordinate with the legitimate, freedom-loving Iranian government to ensure they have translators, staff and vehicles available."
USA_american_loans_desc:0 "The Iranians have run out of money from our initial loan to them! This simply won't do, they are fighting tooth and nail against the enemies of democracy and freedom. Let us pull some strings at the congressional budget office to authorize further Liberty Loans to the Iranian liberals. No amount of money is worth a loss to fascist tyranny."
USA_send_in_cia_advisors_desc:0 "While not mentioned in the official Iranian Aid Act, in the black budget we have set aside money for advisors from REDACTED to instruct and share REDACTED with the Iranian REDACTED services. It is our REDACTED 's hope that this will lead to REDACTED, increased trust, REDACTED, REDACTED, higher recruitment of Persian-speaking operatives, REDACTED, and new perspectives on the regional intelligence situation, especially in regards to REDACTED."
USA_grand_strategy_of_the_iran_war_desc:0 "With the Iranian Civil War still dragging on, our administration finds itself on a crossroads. Should we commit fully, South Africa-style, with boots on the ground and a strong hand, or should we press on with the current strategy of primarily arming the Iranian liberals and letting them fight the war for us? We will need to carefully weigh whether the risk of upsetting the public with another foreign conflict is worth the risk of losing Iran to the forces of tyranny. The economic and geopolitical consequences of the fascists controlling the oil of Iran could be devastating, but a direct intervention can seriously undermine our popularity, not to mention our military budget plans. What should we do?"
USA_promise_more_american_soldiers_desc:0 "We have to go all in on this one, public opinion be damned. We are readying several divisions of intervention troops to help the liberal Iranians win this thing, and have already sent them our assurances more are on their way. Democracy will never die where the torch of liberty shines bright through its soldiers! Forwards to freedom!"
USA_promise_more_american_equipment_desc:0 "We cannot risk another bloodbath like we faced in the jungles this decade. To limit the potential loss of American life without letting the Iranians down, we will instead announce an expansion of our current strategy, with efforts undertaken to greatly increase the quantity of weapons shipments to the Iranian liberals. This will be difficult, but we will be enjoying the cooperation and support of our military-industrial complex, which stands to benefit from the Liberty Loans being spent on their product line."
USA_to_free_the_oppressed_desc:0 "To help build popular support for our intervention in Iran, we have crafted a carefully staged media campaign showing our soldiers and the Iranian liberals working in tandem to bring freedom to the oppressed classes of Iran. Zoroastrians, Christians and women will all feature heavily in the messaging, with starry eyes thanking their American liberators. The coverage will even be mostly true for once, as we really fight on the side of the most tolerant and Western-aligned faction present."
USA_darwin_supply_hub_desc:0 "The biggest hurdle in supplying the Iranians has been that we've relied on Australian shipping for the last stretch of the journey. If we instead repurpose and expand our naval base at Darwin, intended for use in supplying allies and intervention forces in Indonesia, as well as defending Australasia proper, we can move the supplies the whole way on American keel, in larger and faster freighters. This should enable us to greatly expand the transported volume, albeit at a significant monetary cost."
USA_new_contracts_for_military_industral_complex_desc:0 "The promise of fresh contracts delivered the expected support from the large armaments firms. A group of them have promised that they will invest in any efforts we make to expand the supply pipeline to Iran, on the condition that it is structured in such a way as to give them a voice in the running of the products. In normal times this sort of collusion with private arms manufacturers might be seen as unethical, but the last twenty years have been anything but normal, and we have to be ready to work with all our allies to defeat fascism, whether they be countries or corporations. Let us begin the restructuring."
USA_the_beacon_of_hope_desc:0 "We have done everything we can for the Iranian liberals. As we ship off the last of our promised supplies and men, we can only hope that the sacrifices America has made to help the Iranian people rise the torch of liberty against the extremist tyrants surrounding the liberals on all sides. One day, Iran will be a true democracy and close ally of our great republic, but if the liberals can win here and now, we will have progressed tremendously in pushing back the darkness of our age. Let the flame of freedom we have lit in the Iranian people forever serve as a beacon of hope to the oppressed all around the Middle East and the World!"

 USA.1.desc:0 "While America joined the Second World War, support came too late to save her allies. The United States performed admirably, humbling the Kriegsmarine in the Atlantic and beginning to turn the tide in the Pacific, but the invention of the atom bomb ended any hopes of American victory for those few remaining Allies.\n\nNow, twenty years later, America stands divided. While the great American Depression is slowly ending, the American political scene sits in chaos. The government remains locked between the uneasy Republican-Democrats and the National Progressive Party, a failing union of America's progressives, socialists and authoritarians. With the Civil Rights movement greatly shifting the political sphere, many predict that the 60's will herald the greatest threats America has ever faced."

 USA.2.desc:0 "In 1954, right before Brown vs. Board, a note that circulated between the liberal judges on the supreme court is leaked to the press. The note refered to a fifth possible judge that could potentially vote in favor of ruling that segregation in education is unconstitutional. This fired up the public and the Southern Democrats signed the so-called Southern Manifesto that declare they would not stand for the party line that lead to this possible outcome and will go into Patton's NPP party to continue working for continued segregation, whatever the outcome of the Brown vs. Board would be.\n\nThey rallied their voters to join the NPP and they managed to nominate their Harry F. Byrd to the 1956 Presidency, the campaign was a failure, and only carried a few states. The 1960 elections didn't go much better with Richard Russell Jr. as their candidate. After the second fiasco in a row, many of the senators lost their seats to Democrats and others crossed the aisle a second time in only 5 years.\n\nThey figured they couldn't run only on a segregationst platform, with appeals only to white southern voters. Their whole tone of their politics was thought to be too "nice", voters didnt understand what the difference between the NPP and the Democrats were, so they voted democrat, to not waste their vote. Some stayed behind as NPP senators, and noticed the new young Governor in Alabama, George Wallace. He is the perfect candidate for the NPP: segregationist, harsh critic of the mainstream foreign policy and has that angry aura, which they lacked. Wallace has since become the face of the NPP Far Right faction and stands to be their 1964 candidate."

CIA assets in Germania have reported that shortly after celebrations over the moon landing began to settle, German military units and several platoons worth of the German dictator's various bodyguard units filled the streets and immediately put the city under martial law. From what we are hearing, an assassin, which the Germans claim had belonged to the Japanese Kenpeitai, attempted to kill the Führer, but was stopped in his attempt by one of Hitler's personal bodyguards, and killed on the spot.\n\nAlready, reports of several assassinations have surfaced, as various politicians in the Reichstag initially believed Hitler to have been killed and began long-planned plots to eliminate their rivals in the chaos. In the streets, the various military units nearly came to blows, as various units ordered one other to stand down and the chain of command broke down.\n\nWhile the situation has begun to recover, martial law is still in effect in Germania, and suddenly, the Reich seems much weaker. In Washington, this raises the question - how can the Germans maintain their New World Order when they can hardly handle themselves?"

Köllner, on live television broadcast globally, snapped a smart salute to the flag of the Reich with the earth visible in the backdrop, a photo which has spread across the globe, thanks in no small part to German propaganda. Jubilant celebrations began almost immediately across Germany.\n\nAlready, President Nixon has publicly vowed that the race shall continue and that NASA is already making preparations for a permanent human presence upon the moon, in the form of a lunar colony. The President's announcement was quickly followed by one from Japan, who stated that they will land on Mars.\n\nDespite the President's insistence that the race is not over, the American public has taken the news poorly. Although America managed to get the first astronaut into space, public confidence in the space program is at an all-time low, as fewer Americans than ever look to the night sky with a sense of explorative awe."

But his brilliancy has not gone without controversy, and the chess community has descended into chaos after he has recently refused to defend his title against Germany.\n\nFollowing his perfect victory in the 1963 US Championship, Fischer has made multiple fascist and pro-German statements, becoming an official member of the extreme right of the National Progressive Party. He has openly described himself as a Yockey, and has made numerous racist statements towards the Japanese and has undergone virulent anti-semitic triades during tournaments, despite him being half-Jewish himself, a label which he passionately rejects. In this year's 1972 Chess Championship, held in Reykjavík, Iceland, he has verbally attacked both the United States and FIDE, culminating in him surrendering the chance for him to play against Klaus Darga of Germany, automatically awarding him the new world champion by default.\n\nHe has answered to the press's questioning with "I refuse to let my name be associated with that of Jewish deceit...

Yesterday, he boarded a small plane to Germany, claiming to have been contested by a local club in Bavaria. However, upon arrival, he instead entered a government office where he renounced his citizenship to the United States and declared allegiance to the Reich. After a short internment, the Führer announced him welcome, praising him for his outspoken remarks and his decision to forfeit from the championship. The rumours of his half-Jewish ancestry seemed to have been overlooked by authorities. He has confirmed to the press that his emigration is permanent, citing recent actions to "silence" him by the American government.\n\nAlthough some are graceful that we will no longer have to deal with that little shit's mouth anymore, the game's community has mourned the loss of our finest player nevertheless. In the Reich, Fischer has been appointed a personal instructor for him to learn Deutsch, and already has current champion Klaus Darga gave him the go-ahead to play with him against the United States in 1975. With no hope in winning FIDE's next competition, this intellectual battlefield, however minor, has been conclusively lost to fascism. What we have sacrificed may have been just a pawn, but every piece matters as the game unfolds..."

The United States government has restricted Fischer's behavior since, monitoring his games and preventing him from attending conferences for the German-American Bund. Yesterday, he boarded a small plane to Bavaria, claiming to have been contested by a local club. However, upon arrival he instead entered a foreign ministry where he renounced his citizenship to the United States and declared allegiance to the Reich, offering to play for our cause in the future.\n\nUpon being notified of the grandmaster's internment, the Führer has personally announced him welcome, praising him for his outspoken remarks and appointing him a private instructor for him to learn Deutsch. All those foolish enough to wish to challenge him will now have to do so within our borders. Although there exists rumours that Fischer is half-Jewish himself, we have decided to believe his own claim that he descends from German blood only. In the meantime, Fischer has considered developing his own chess variant for our own people, "Überchess." With Darga agreeing to play with him against the United States in 1975, we are now certain of our dominance over the game's global scene. The rest of the chess world now perpetually belongs in our check."

With one fell swoop, we will stop the Nazis from securing a new foothold in Africa, for if we do not, surely the brutal invasion of our South African partners will only be the beginning. If Africa falls, next falls India, then with the east secured, the Nazis will soon be in the Americas as well!\n\nAt least, this is the sentiment that every American general with a foot in the White House door has loudly shouted, berated the Senate over, rallied their troops with and harassed the media with as seemingly every man who has ever held a gun has proclaimed the time for a 'final battle' against the fascist menace.\n\nWhile many members of the Republican-Democrat party have seemed nervous over the situation, proposing some doubts that this 'Domino Theory' is as immediate a threat as proposed, or that entering war with direct servants of the Reich can end in anything besides a greater conflict, it is most surprising that several members of the NPP have stepped across the Senate aisle to agree. Leftists in the NPP have questioned what, exactly, the R-D dominated military establishment proposes as any end goal in this conflict, and what plan they may have to deal with Africa even if there is some sort of victory, while the far right of the party has showed some suspicious hesitance to do battle with the fascists.\n\nRegardless, however, the President seems dead-set on an intervention in the South African conflict, with President Nixon seemingly hoping that a knockout punch on the Reich Commissioners will save his flagging administration and halt the impending impeachment vote."

Disease and famine were common, and the regimes cared little for their people beyond how much wealth could be extracted before they ran dry. This has to change.\n\nOur South African allies have taken administrative control over Namibia, Rhodesia and southern Mozambique.

Worst of all the ANC now enjoys a wide base of support, both from the native African population and whatever is left of the old reichskommissarat forces.\n\nSouth Africa's garrisons have proven ineffective at containing the ANC rebels within their zone of administration. As they are often misled into traps by local African villagers, and despite the harsh reprisals such actions engender they show no signs of stopping. The local regions around South African garrisons are slowly transformed into wastelands patroled by brutal military patrols, for some, it is as the Rechiskommisarats never left.\n\nAs it stands South Africa is slowly taking the place of the old German colonies, both domestically and abroad.

Ironically disguised as a Jewish American, his mission was to secure a job at Bell Telephone, study their communications infrastructure, and identify flaws for the installation of wiretaps and other espionage methods. Even more concerning was that his phone book had the telephone number of several local NPP politicians inside, and it seemed he was trying to contact the party's fringe elements, including the fascist agitator Francis Parker Yockey.\n\nCharges for violation of the Espionage Act are already being brought against him, though he will likely end up simply being deported back to Germany, rather than facing a long prison term in the United States."

The Boers live relatively isolated from wider South African society, and hold proud traditions of political independence and armed defense. An organized uprising is likely in the near future.\nC) A direct invasion by South Africa's northern neighbors, the African Reichskommissariats (Reich Commissariats), would be very unlikely in the current situation. As they almost entirely rely on their mother nation to provide material and political support to prop up their governments, all their military forces are tied up in internal peacekeeping operations.

Internal memos from the 1960 Progressive National Convention, transcripts of private conversations between NPP senators, schematics on wiretaps, photos taken inside NPP campaign headquarters, and most chillingly, a letter from Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman authorizing the espionage.

Surprisingly, the blackmailer showed up suspecting nothing, and was immediately nabbed by federal agents.\n\nThe blackmailer turned out to be a 24 year old NPP activist, one Charles B. Juno, but they have had little success getting more than that out of him. He has refused to say anything besides requests for a lawyer, but fingerprint evidence has left no doubt to him being the one who sent the envelope. The Bureau's best guess is that he's a misguided progressive who wanted to force through change with some underhanded methods, but that's all they've got to go on. Charges of espionage and mail fraud are already working their way through the pipeline, and he'll hopefully go to trial by November.

The Secret Service immediately began investigating potential leads in the mail room, but to little success so far.

The NPP were desperately scrambling to summon a press conference and denounce the accusations, and the press would likely not put them in a sympathetic light. Meanwhile, Nixon ordered for a press conference of his own to be called soon, where he could address the "deeply troubling implications" of these stories head-on.

The FBI's investigation into the origin of the blackmailers had seen little success, but there still remained the question of what to do with the blackmail itself. Hoover, ever cautious and considerate, asked the President whether it would be best to seal it away in some classified vault or destroy it as much as possible.

Powers evaded the missile, then proceeded on course, completing his mission and returning to Eisenhower AFB in Iceland.\n\nDue to the classified nature of the mission, we cannot let it be known publicly that our aircraft was engaged by German fighters.

Sure, the bill may have been first endorsed by Kennedy, but he'd had nothing to do with writing it, or even wrangling Senate votes for it! Nixon was becoming hated in the South-well, more hated than before-while Kennedy was lapping up all the glory everywhere else. His mind briefly flashed with horrifying images of Kennedy standing at the podium at the '64 national convention, graciously accepting their nomination for President, with the American people blithely forgetting what happened the last time they elected a Kennedy.

Couldn't those dumb kids see they were the reason he did it? He'd refused to cave to a bunch of doped-up so-called "progressives" demanding he do too much too quickly, and for that they said he was Hitler. Literally, as it turned out; he caught a glimpse of a placard where his face had been cut out from a campaign poster and pasted on an image of a saluting Führer.\n\nHe rolled his eyes and closed the curtains. He hoped they'd learn their lesson and simmer down, but that would probably be asking a bit too much of them.

On January 20th, a Kenpeitai agent attacked Adolf Hitler in an attempt to assassinate him but was stopped short by German security forces, who swiftly shot him dead. Despite the undeniable Kenpeitai connections held by the agent, leaked Abwehr documents and sources close to SUNSHINE show no evidence of Japanese involvement despite material and method matching perfectly. This is corroborated by both SAUKRA and LILY, but sources close to the IJN and IJA could not further verify the information, and friendly agents in Germania were unable to retrieve the body and weapon for closer analysis.\n2. Hitler's health has been in a state of constant decline ever since the signing of the 1945 Armistice. There is now strong reason to believe he is no longer competent to lead Germany, as many of his duties have been delegated out to various ministers and aides. Any attempt at high level diplomatic contact should be considered impossible while Germany lacks a competent Fuehrer.\n3. Despite an official nomination of a successor, the Fuhrer's succession line is far from assured. With the four candidates jostling for favor from the army, students, and other power bases, the situation is quickly turning volatile. The immediate withdrawal of SUNSHINE and EAGLE is recommended for consideration.\n4. Adolf Hitler is estimated to have a maximum of six (6) months left to live.\n5. Should Adolf Hitler die, a wide-scale armed conflict is almost inevitable in Germany.\n6. Should an extended conflict break out in Germany, the Unity Pakt is likely to collapse, though armed conflict between the German Reichskommissariats (Reich Commissariats) seems unlikely, with internal unrest posing a much greater issue for many of them.\n\n-TOP SECRET-"

The only ones that were gone related to some re-election campaign strategies for 1964, and those thankfully contained no mention of certain stunts pulled during the last election.

Needless to say, the outrage from the National Progressive Party was immediate and fierce. George Wallace took to national television in the afternoon in an interview upon the front steps of the Alabama Capitol, in which he looked to the cameras and called President Nixon a "corrupt crook," and concluded with demands that he resign at once.\n\nThe White House and the Republican-Democrat National Convention have clammed up for the time being, refusing to issue a statement to the press about the documents' origins or veracity. While keeping their heads low and letting it blow over may have worked in the past with minor scandals, something as broad as this is simply too massive to ignore.

He danced around the questions with such grace that plenty of people seemed to overlook that he never gave a direct answer at all. He changed topics, he spun yarns, he equivocated, but even all his skills couldn't stop the question of the wiretaps from coming up again and again.\n\nFinally, he decided to confront one reporter's question of "To what extent would you cooperate with a federal investigation into the possibility of a cover-up?" head-on.\n\nAfter a lengthy non-answer on the values of liberty and egalitarianism, he concluded with "I will cooperate, and in fact welcome, this sort of investigation. I have never attempted to cover up a crime or obstruct justice, because I have committed no crimes to cover up. This investigation will tell the American people what they need to know: whether or not their President is a crook. Well, I am not a crook.""

In what could only be described as miraculous, no sailors or dock workers were killed, but three Japanese sailors and an American fireman suffered serious burns during the explosion and subsequent attempts to put it out.\n\nThe Japanese government is apoplectic with rage, with their ambassador describing the bombing as "all but an act of war," and presenting a long list of demands, which they had likely drafted some time ago and were waiting for the opportunity, as reparation. Most notable are a massive increase in security around the ports (all on America's dime, of course) and a televised apology from President Nixon himself.\n\nNixon, needless to say, refuses to let things go over that poorly.

If they begin, he would be the first President to be impeached since Andrew Johnson, nearly a century prior. But that is not what concerns Nixon.

 USA.109.desc:0 ""The Civil Rights Act simply means that it's another means, that it's another effort on the part of this president to dominate the country by force and to put into effect these uncalled for and the damnable proposals he has recommended under the guise of so-called 'civil rights.' And I tell you, the American people, from one side to the other, had better wake up and oppose such a program, and if they don't the next thing will be a totalitarian state in these United States."\n\nEfforts to move any sort of Civil Rights legislation through the Senate have yet again met resistance from conservatives within the party. This time, however, the filibusters and angry outbursts are delivered to a room with a very different atmosphere. With popular support for the bill only growing, once staunch opponents are beginning to waver, and some NPP senators have even approached us in secret to give their support for the bill.\n\nMany experts are now predicting that the bill now has a very real chance of passing the senate, especially with Vice President Kennedy's authorship."

 USA.110.t:0 "Cracks in the Foundation"
 USA.110.desc:0 ""I won't give my country over to you fascists, and certainly I won't give my country over to those goddamn bastards!"\n\nIn a (not so) surprising move yesterday, the votes required to shut down the filibuster started by Robert Byrd came not from the Republican-Democrats, but from moderate senators within the NPP. Despite the invocation of cloture, several Southern Democrats continued on increasingly incomprehensible tirades, and had to be forcibly removed from the chambers.\n\nTheir return today also brought a nasty surprise, as Strom Thurmond, Robert Byrd, and several other senators announced their defection from the Republican-Democrats. Estranged from the increasingly progressive stance of their party, this move comes as an expected, but nonetheless nasty shock to the already troubled party.\n\nDespite agreeing to take the defectors, many NPP senators have publicly and privately expressed their concerns regarding the right-wing views of the defectors. Whether or not pragmatism will mend these internal rifts remains to be seen."
 USA.110.a:0 "A few defectors are nothing in the grand scheme of things."

 USA.111.t:0 "15 Minutes of Fury"
 USA.111.desc:0 "The wave of violence prompted by the Birmingham bombings spilled onto the Senate floor yesterday, when a heated argument turned physical after several provocative statements. Reportedly, the brawl started after Senator James Eastland commented that "those bastards got what they deserved", prompting a currently unknown assailant to throw a punch in response. In the 15 minutes that it took Capitol Police to entirely control the situation, senators destroyed five chairs, two desks, and a chandelier, also damaging the Senate Gavel beyond repair. In total, 27 senators had to be forcibly detained and removed, and 34 treated for their wounds, albeit mostly no worse than a broken nose or blackened eye.\n\nThis shocking incident has galvanized many already-unhappy Republican-Democrats to renounce their party membership and align with the opposing National Progressive Party. Surprisingly, both pro and anti-Civil Rights party members were among the defectors, resulting in another smaller incident where senators Lyndon B. Johnson and Strom Thurmond had to be forcibly separated when they approached Minority Leader Paul Douglas at the same time, looking for an altercation."
 USA.111.a:0 "Triple the security, and make sure they're armed."

 USA.112.t:0 "98 Angry Senators"
 USA.112.desc:0 "It seems that the previous defections have prompted another wave of senators to flee the Republican-Democrat party and align with the NPP. Dissatisfaction with the party's inaction has driven a stake deeper than anyone could have imagined. With several senators a day renouncing their party membership, news outlets and record keepers have had a hard time tracking the rapidly fluctuating political situation. Estimates still vary widely, but many predict that the Republican-Democrat Party will not survive losing two of its largest wings: the Progressives, and the Segregationists. All that remains to be seen is just how many senators leave.\n\nIn slightly better news, friction between the rapidly growing Center and Far-Right wings of the NPP has already become apparent, with vocal internal party debates not uncommon on the Senate floor. Where once the Center block of the NPP held a comfortable majority of the party's seats, this is no longer the case, its once total dominance challenged by die-hard segregationists who have flocked to the NPP over the years. A once united voting block now stalls in a growing deadlock, the avenging eagle of the NPP united only in name.\n\nYet, despite the disunity of the NPP, their ranks continue to swell, and soon it is predicted that the President will be fighting congress before the 1964 election."

 USA.113.t:0 "Nixon's Plot"
 USA.113.desc:0 "The Civil Rights issue seems to have no end in sight, families, friends, and even Congress divided on the best solution. Our great President Nixon, however, has come up with a plan to put down the dissent once and for all. Those goddamn liberals will learn to fall in line. And they will, after Nixon crushes whatever crazy, un-American legislation they've come up with by his own hand. Estimates show that by turning his silence into lukewarm, verbal-only support, there'll be just enough support to clear a supportive bill in the Senate.\n\nAnd Vice President Kennedy has just the bill."
 USA.113.a:0 "They're walking right into it, the suckers."

 USA.114.t:0 "Progressive Backlash"
 USA.114.desc:0 "The response to Nixon's surprise veto has not been subdued to say the least. What fell upon the Senate after the veto was not chaos, not calamity, but a thick silence. One moment, and then two. And then nothing.\n\nAt least for a few days.\n\nLed by senators Humphrey and Johnson, the entire Progressive block of the Republican-Democrat party has renounced their allegiance to the party, and indeed, marched out of the Senate chambers in a display of protest. Vice President Kennedy, who authored and spearheaded the bill, has refused to comment.\n\nWith the NPP gaining a torrent of support, the hegemony of the Republican-Democrats now comes under fire, and an upheaval in Congress and even the Presidency looks more and more likely."
 USA.114.a:0 "Idiots. We don't need them anyway."

 USA.115.t:0 "Intensification of the Movement"
 USA.115.desc:0 "Though the Civil Rights movement has always been present, especially after our defeat in the Second World War, recent reports have indicated an increase in violence, polarization, and popularity--both for and against the movement. Even Congress isn't free from the issue, with the Progressives in the Republican-Democrat party constantly in conflict with the Segregationists and Conservatives. And amongst it all, the NPP revels in the chaos.\n\nIt seems that the populace is no longer satisfied with our platitudes, finally recognizing our feet-dragging for what it is. We can only continue to stay the course for so long.\n\nThe nation of America is taking sides, and it's only so long before they arm themselves."
 USA.115.a:0 "There is still plenty of time."

 USA.116.t:0 "Nearing the Breaking Point"
 USA.116.desc:0 "The issue of civil rights continues to grow out of control, as both its supporters and its detractors gain momentum and militancy. Protests and counter-protests frequently devolve into bloody clashes, city police forces are stretched thin, and at least one state has its National Guard mobilized at any given time.\n\nEven the Senate has not kept itself above this enmity. Republican-Democrat and National Progressive Senators fight over every issue, using day-long filibusters to break issues, and neither party being able to get a supermajority to invoke cloture and actually vote.\n\nUltimately, there is only one solution to break this cultural and political deadlock, and the only man who can do it seemingly has no interest. President Nixon sits paralyzed and tight-lipped, almost if convinced that if he refuses to act, the problem will somehow solve itself and go away. While that may very well happen, it is unclear just how long it may be before the situation starts to improve. And things have the potential to get much, much worse."
 USA.116.a:0 "We have to act... or do we?"

 USA.117.t:0 "A Torrent of Blood"
 USA.117.desc:0 "The city of Birmingham, Alabama was founded in 1871 by the Elyton Land Company. It quickly grew into the "Pittsburgh of the South" with the arrival of U.S. Steel. Racial tensions have always been high, doubly so with black migration into the city, and triply so with the KKK's ready access to dynamite, other explosives, and firearms.\n\nAnd now everything has come to a head in Birmingham. As yet another anti-segregationist protest made its way through the city center, explosions raked the already contentious demonstration, engulfing protester and counter-protester alike in a blaze of shock and debris. Initial reports place the casualties at 89 killed, and several hundred more wounded, but this number is likely to grow as the survivors of both sides begin to turn on each other, blaming the bomb upon their opposition. Further details are hazy, as unidentified gunfire forced first responders and journalists to retreat. Images and footage of the violence are being broadcast nationwide, with seemingly every station forgoing usual programming to report on the situation at all hours.\n\nGovernor Wallace has refused to send in the Alabama National Guard, publicly citing safety concerns and deployment fatigue. State police forces are scrambling, but seem content to safely contain the fighting instead of intervening.\n\nThe situation on the ground has only continued to deteriorate, and both sides of the Civil Rights issue have quickly rallied around "Bloody Wednesday", each side blaming the other. Fortunately, there is one message both sides are uniting around. Unfortunately, it is one calling for the President to step down."
 USA.117.a:0 "Oh my god..."

 USA.1738.t:0 "Nixon's Dilemma"
 USA.1738.desc:0 "President Nixon had been sitting in silence at the Resolute desk for almost a full minute. Speaker John W. McCormack, who had come in expecting to make a grand presentation, was now sitting across from him and growing more uncomfortable by the minute. He had expected Nixon to read through the bill he'd handed him and then quickly offer a signature. Instead, Nixon just stared at the heading at the top of the first page:\n\n"The Kennedy Civil Rights Act."\n\nJack had some fucking nerve, thought Nixon. It was him, Johnson and the other Republicans who'd managed to bring this bill through the Senate. To be sure, Kennedy had introduced the bill and wrangled some holdout Democrats to get behind it, but he sure as shit didn't deserve the credit for this act. What was he playing at? Was this about redeeming his family name after what Joe Sr. had done to the party? Did Jack just hate the thought of Nixon being praised once in a blue moon?\n\nAn idea crossed Nixon's mind. If he vetoed this act, Kennedy would be ruined. The R-D's didn't have a supermajority in the Senate to overturn his veto. His vice-president would have no choice but to stand by his decision. It would be the embarrassment of a lifetime. And yet...Nixon would go down with him. He wasn't a racist, he'd campaigned for Civil Rights in 1960. It would be insane to veto this act. Vetoing a landmark bill like this, especially on the heels of Bloody Wednesday, would be cutting off his nose to spite his face. Yet Kennedy would finally get what he deserved.\n\nNixon came to his senses and realized how anxious McCormack was getting. He needed to give him an answer now. He opened his mouth and said,"
 USA.1738.a:0 ""I will gladly sign this bill, Mr. Speaker.""
 USA.1738.b:0 ""Due to critical technical issues, I have no choice but to veto this bill.""

 USA.118.t:0 "The Long Road Ahead"
 USA.118.desc:0 "President Nixon has paid the price for his apathy. Many outspoken members of the Republican-Democrats, whether progressives or segregations, have announced that they refuse to share a party with such a spineless coward, and those few activist Congressmen who remain with the R-Ds have condemned his "destructive inaction" for leading to "senseless-and wholly preventable-deaths."\n\nBut despite the defections, the denunciations, and the Congressional fistfight, the Republican-Democrats still hold a majority in the Senate-if only barely. Nixon is still in power, but the odds of him and his party retaining it beyond 1964 are minimal. His approval ratings are at an all-time low, and Republican-Democrats' polling numbers are in freefall. They are matched by an equally meteoric rise in support for the National Progressive Party, both among Northern liberals and Southern conservatives.\n\nNixon is still the captain and the ship still sails, but its rudder is broken, its crew is deserting, and it may begin to rapidly take on water. He may guide it to port, but the odds of that are growing slimmer by the day."

On announcement, a certain few of our troops took unauthorized absences, trying to flee from deployment. While this is unfortunate, it is quite small scale, and can be explained as cowards in the military looking for a free lunch. The army as a whole is prepared for deployment, with no prevalent signs of cowardice or hesitation in the men. This event will surely remain isolated."

After a tense operation at St. Joseph's Hospital, King's condition stabilized, although he will likely still be recovering for some weeks.\n\nIn the meantime, the suspected assassin, one James Earl Ray, was taken into custody in Atlanta, while attempting to board a flight to Toronto. The investigation into King's shooting has been taken over by the FBI, which is already probing connections between Ray and the far right of the National Progressive Party. It is unsure how far those connections will go, but reports of Ray's past as an ardent white supremacist surely won't help his case."

 USA.130.desc_cr_passed:0 "The National Progressive Party Convention concluded today with a rather surprising outcome. After multiple ballots, with candidates representing each of the many factions of the party over the whole spectrum of politics including Micheal Harrington and Scoop Jackson, a clear winner emerged: George Wallace.\n\nThe controversial Alabama Governor, with his well known and outspoken views on segregation and support for the Jim Crow laws of the Southern states, focused most of his primary campaign not on the debates about Civil Rights, but on the corruption of the current Republican-Democrat Administration and the increasing power of the federal government. He successfully torpedoed the C-NPP's leadership due to their division. Thus handing the nod to Wallace.\n\nIn his victory speech, the Governor spoke not simply as running as President for the South, but for all of America. "I intend to give the American people a clear choice. I welcome a fight between our philosophy and the corruption and heavy handedness of Washington, telling us what to do, what to think, which now threatens to engulf every man, woman, and child in the United States. I am in this race because I believe the American people have been pushed around long enough and that they, like you and I, are fed up with the continuing trend toward a corrupt Banana Republic which now subjects the individual to the dictates of an all-powerful central government."\n\nWallace has great support in the Southern states, and pockets of support in coservative enclaves who despise the increasing power of government in their lives, and millions more that just want to banish the corrupt and dirty politics of Nixon to the history book as fast as possible. It just remains to be seen if this can translate into victory in November."

 USA.130.desc_cr_blocked:0 "The National Progressive Party Convention concluded today with, perhaps one of the greatest shocks in the American political system since the unification of the Republican-Democrats and the rise of the NPP itself. After multiple ballots, with candidates representing each of the many factions of the party including George Wallace, Micheal Harrington and Scoop Jackson, a clear winner emerged: Robert Francis Kennedy.\n\nHow "Bobby" Kennedy, the brother and Chief of Staff of former President John F. Kennedy, and the seventh of nine children of former President Joseph P. Kennedy, and was President Nixon's campaign manager in 1960 and who took the nation at storm with an explosive speech criticizing the party of his father and brother for failing to live up to the people, became the standard bearer of the opposition party just four years later is still a shock that many are trying to come to terms with. Perhaps it was the sidelining of his brother as scandal engulfed the White House, or perhaps to simply make a clean break from the corruption of the current Administration and of his own past to serve his nation. The true answer may be that Robert was infuriated with the President's vetoing of the Civil Rights Act, stalling, if not ending the dream of equality for all races. This issue, which RFK has championed since he first got into politics, managed to obliterate his closest competitor, the segregationist Governor Wallace.\n\nIn his victory speech, Robert Kennedy made his support for Civil Rights adamant. "We must recognize the full human equality of all of our people before God, before the law, and in the councils of government. We must do this, not because it is economically advantageous, although it is; not because the laws of God command it, although they do; not because people in other lands wish it so. We must do it for the single and fundamental reason that it is the right thing to do."\n\nAlready RFK has great support across the nation: from African-Americans seeking to end the terrors of Jim Crow, blue collar workers that see him as their strongest advocate, progressives wishing to make the US a more equal society, and millions more that just want to banish the corrupt and dirty politics of Nixon to the history book as fast as possible.

The new president is characterised by a strong, populist rhetoric, emphasizing the struggle of the American people against the political elite.\n\nThis is a major shakeup for US politics, and shows that the American people are ready for change that the current Republican-Democrat platform simply cannot provide.\n\nAnd now, a special report on the Russian anarchy, presented by a man who spent years traveling the wastelands-"

 USA.142.t:0 "The Hope Massacre"
 USA.142.desc:0 "On August 31st, 1946, John Hersey published the article O'ahu in The New Yorker. In 160 pages of detailed, emotionally-charged narrative, he accounts the lives and aftermath of six Hawaiian-American civilians who survived the atomic blast. The Japanese cruisers landed on their shores scarcely a week later, and forced them to stay on the islands, calmly telling them that if they want the charred corpses of their families to rest in peace, they will have to bury them themselves. "The six of them all share one pain: they envy the dead," Hersey wrote.\n\nOver one million Americans, still reeling after the horror of the atom was revealed to them only two years prior, opened up their Saturday morning magazines, expecting comforting satire and laughter. But as they read its prose, all they felt was their hearts suffocating with sorrow and dread towards the nuclear holocaust Germany and Japan now ceaselessly march towards.\n\nIt is twenty years later, and America opens up another special edition of The New Yorker to find the same horror once again, now directed towards the crimes of our own nation. Sprawled across the first page is an aerial photograph of hundreds of mutilated corpses strewn out across a river flowing with blood, all positioned in the shape of a massive swastika. The perpetrators have been confirmed to be a U.S. Army company, who, deployed to search a village in the deep rainforest, were allegedly ambushed by a group of unidentified combatants while crossing the Orange River. Fueled by rage, the officers ordered for the bodies of the fallen to be rearranged into the symbol of hate.\n\nGeneral William Westmoreland's own attache conservatively estimates that the composition was made out of 347 stormtroopers that attempted to capture and torture the infantry division. Rejecting this, anti-war activist Tom Hayden's private correspondents assert that the photo was composed of 504 unarmed Boer settlers who happened to walk in the direction of the death squad's nightly patrol. We have yet to receive an official statement from any German authorities that isn't composed entirely of vague, slur-riddled insults.\n\nThe article begins with the suicide letter of Private First Class Varnado Simpson, who hanged himself from guilt on March 16th, hours after the massacre. The investigation eventually lead to the discovery of the war crime. "We formed the [swastika's] center with dead infants and exhumed animals," he wrote. "Lord, have mercy on their souls, not mine.""

Though it's unsurprisingly not uncommon for the winners of a gubernatorial election to celebrate the fact, this is a more momentous occasion than it appears on the surface.\n\nFor the first time, a politician of the National Progressive Party has been re-elected to any position, and the party members are celebrating all across the nation. Even those from the left-leaning Center faction, opposed to the policy of Wallace's Far Right faction, can be found celebrating the party's triumph.

They appear to have escaped during the night, as the three prisoners went into their cells the night before, and were absent from roll call the next morning. A brief survey of their cells found tunnels dug through the walls, and paper-mâché dolls in the prisoner's beds. A frantic search found no trace of the three prisoners on the island, and it was only when mainland police found a shoddy raft along with prison clothes that the it was realized that Alcatraz had been successfully escaped from. More worrying than the fact that multiple people escaped from an 'impenetrable' facility however, is the fact that two of the escapees are members of the German-American Bund, including Vice President and KKK member: Arthur Hornbui Bell.\n\nThis has, predictably, caused an incredible amount of outrage amongst the populace. Not only did a prison that was 'inescapable' broken out of, but a major member of the German-American Bund is now at large in the USA. All across the country, as bizarre and stupid as it may seem, people lock their doors at night and peek out their windows to see if Bell himself will come to their doors.\n\nThe Republicans have demanded that the police make the hunt for the fugitives the top priority, while Democrats say that such a move would only make the escaped rats hide even deeper, and that the police should not give this case any more priority than an average case.

The President himself reportedly expressed joy upon the capture of the Three, and is expected to award those who devoted themselves to the search.\n\nAfter they were captured, the Alcatraz Three were interrogated on a variety of matters, including details of their escape, and in the case of Arthur Hornbui Bell, more questions about his membership in the German-American Bund. Bell has predictably remained quiet on those issues, but surprisingly ranted at length about the 'inhumane' conditions he was kept in at Alcatraz.

A massive tome, called 'A Theory of Justice', drawing both on Kantian and Humean traditions, describes Rawls' theory of how the social contract makes political life possible. He asks us to imagine an 'original position' from where we should design how we want society to be, without knowing where in society we would be placed. From this he believes there are two principles of justice that could be formulated:\n\n1. Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all.\n\n2. Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both: (a) to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged, consistent with the just savings principle, and (b) attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity.\n\nRawls is happy to finally have it published so he can go campaign for the upcoming senate election, where he hopes to gain the seat for the Center faction of NPP.\n\nSome party tops have already praised it for its commitment to social justice, especially its insistence on a global perspective, and some members have been bold and predicted the book to become a leading piece of theory for the growing party, as social justice is connected with systems of justice and injustice across the globe. People in Colorado are in a sense not free until people in Tokyo or Germania are free, free from systematic injustice. It is thus each state's duty to fight for the freedom of justice of all people wherever they are!"

In 46 years of life, he had been blessed with many momentous occasions: flying his first combat mission over the Marshall Islands, careening towards the stars on Friendship 7, even quitting NASA after Nixon cut its funding. However, all of those life-changing events seemed trivial as a host of his countrymen stared in admiration as he slipped his hands off of that pristine little bible upon which he swore the oath of office. Now, millions keenly watched him standing in front of the Lincoln Memorial to hear his first words as President; words that would define the fate of his country and possibly all of mankind.\n\n"Today, we as a nation are brought together not to celebrate the victory of a man, but of a movement and an idea. We celebrate the idea that our homeland is indeed a great society; one unsullied by war, or autocracy, or depression. We celebrate and reaffirm our dedication to freedom, democracy, and the self-determination of all peoples. To make our celebrated ideals into appreciable ones, we must begin anew as a people, just as the world begins anew with the changing of the age and the passing of the generational torch..."\n"...This new page of human history has brought with it many innovations and yet more uncertainties. From these innovations have spawned both terrors and wonders, some of which with the potential to save mankind, and yet others with the capability to destroy it. To truly be a great and freedom-loving society, we must not appreciate those creations of man that implants a balance of terror upon the whole of the species; rather, we should celebrate and develop those creations which may yet bring us to the depths of the oceans, or the distant light of the stars."\n\nPresident Glenn stood slightly taller as tens of thousands of once-dreary, blank faces erupted into smiles and cheers and applause. Through one-hundred-and-forty-nine combat missions, three trips to space, two governorships of Ohio, and a presidential election, he had followed the tides and turns of his life and his country.

Turning around, he scans his eyes over the room, "Who says we have to do anything?"\n\nHaldeman raises an eyebrow, "Dick, he's executing people, we can't let this slide, not with the press on our backs like they are now."\n\n"Since when are we so high and mighty? We've supported men like Burnham in the past, and even if we ignore this, we still have plausible deniability."\n\n"I don't think this is a good idea," Kennedy says, placing a hand on Nixon's shoulder, "I think we owe it to the people of Guyana to help them."\n\nHaldeman looks over to McNamara, who shrugs, "Gotta tell you Bob, I agree with Dick on this one."\n\nHaldeman looks at Nixon, "Well Dick, you're the president.""

Now, perhaps a million voices lay quiet, with their expectant owners wrapped in scarves and coats anxiously awaiting the words of their new President: Jeane Duane Kirkpatrick.\n\n"Among the foremost duties of a government in the provision for the common defense; a guarantee, against external aggression, the survival of our way of life. We must ask ourselves: is the government fulfilling such duties? As evidenced by foreign troops on rightful American soil, and the continued warnings from military men that our current strategy is ineffective, and my very presence on these steps, perhaps the answer is "No". I have been elected and approved by the American people to head a new presidential administration. I know full well the responsibilities placed in me by them and by God, and will fulfill them to the best of my ability..."\n\n"...The troubles faced by our nation today cannot be solved by a single man, or woman. It does not require the sacrifice that so many have made in service to democracy, as in the Argonne, or on Bougainville, or on the dunes of the Namib. However, it does require the best effort of every citizen to believe in themselves and their capacity for great deeds. In this endeavor, I have the utmost confidence in the people of the United States to adapt to and overcome their challenges, for we are the progeny of almost two centuries of great individuals. We are America, and with our exceptional will and the grace of God, no trial shall prove too great for our strength to overcome.""

 USA.1731.d:0 "After a hard-fought election campaign against the NPP, President Wallace F. Bennett was sworn in for his second term as President of the United States today, before cheering crowds on the National Mall. President Bennett noted in his address to the nation that "I see no distinction between party or politics before me; I see only Americans, and a solemn vow to leave the republic stronger tomorrow than it is today."\n\nDespite a heavy emphasis on American tradition and patriotic republicanism, Washington insiders have noted that Bennett has promised nothing radically different from his 1964 campaign: a promise of stability and continuity, the amiable patriarch shepherding America through the social convulsions of the early 1960's and to serve as the linchpin of the free world through the OFN. And this, it seems, is exactly what American voters wanted: a steady pair of hands steering the ship of state into the next decade, tending the hearth of freedom against foreign enemies and domestic radicals."

She shuffled her speech papers.\n\n"To a few of us here today, this is a solemn and awesome moment; and yet, in the tides of American history, it is a regular occurrence. The places in which I stand and in which the nation stands are in many ways the same as they were four years ago, and in many ways they are different. Four years ago I spoke to you, furiously admonishing the injustice done to the United States, and how we might recover from her weakened state. Today, I must give more sobering words, for the revival of a nation is a task not easily undertaken..."\n\n"...Let us resolve that we may build a society in which white and black, rich and poor, young and old, may walk together hand-in-hand for a better future. Today, we utter no prayer more fervently than the ancient prayer for peace on Earth. However, history has shown that peace does not come simply because we wish it to. The United States of America must be ever-vigilant in the face of tyranny. We shall embrace Lady Liberty and defend her, so that she too might defend us. She is our strength in our darkest hour, and with classic American optimism, hope, and strength, we shall prevail through the turbulent storms of change our world is currently experiencing.

He had done a damn fine job, all things considered. His Great Society had proven a hit, the Republican-Democrats were back in top form, and the NPP was still as irrelevant as ever. It had not been an easy task to recover from the colossal screw ups of the last administrations, but he had come out swinging. As he stood before the crowd, however, he knew that now was the time for tact, not boorishness, and so he put aside his usual bravado for the time being.\n\n"Unity is the first and foremost principle of our American union. For we who are small and few against the forces of tyranny, our continued liberty must derive from commonality and the strength of our collective will to endure. Yet true unity cannot be derived from a nation at odds with itself. It is this that I believe is what a Great Society must truly strive for, and what we have endeavored to strive for these past few years. No longer need capitalist and worker nor farmer and clerk struggle against one another, for we may now stand shoulder to shoulder in the interests of increasing the bounty of all...\n\n...from the many great tragedies of the last few decades, the spirit of one great indivisible nation stands unblemished. It is my hope that this spirit may never be extinguished, and it is my earnest wish to continue to protect and nurture this spirit. We are a nation of liberty and justice, blessed by God, and it is our duty to struggle with toil and tears to ensure that the light of our nation shines on. On my part, I promise to you now what I promised the men of my party on that sorrowful day in 1963 - 'I will lead and I will do the best I can'."\n\nOnce more, the crowd roared with appreciation. President Johnson was not a sentimental man, but even he felt the stirrings of pride in his heart. Once more, he had a duty to these people, and it was his solemn oath to fulfil that duty. Four more years lay in front of him, and there was still a lot of work to do. Through the efforts of the Great Society and the efforts of the American people, America was sure to emerge ever greater, and ever more united against all that would seek to tear it down both from within, and without."

In their faces - the men and women, the white man and the black, the Jew and the gentile - he could see for the first time an America that wanted the future to arrive. He beamed as he stepped up to the podium, letting the roaring cheers wash over him. Deep down, he dearly hoped that John was watching, wherever he was.\n\n"We stand here today in the name of liberty and justice. At the heart of western democracy is the belief that all men are created equal, and so the extension of this belief and the enlargement of liberty for all must be the supreme goal of a western society. Others have turned from this goal, and marched on into darkness and decay. Yet where they have faltered, we have pressed forwards, and in four short years we have extended the branch of freedom and human rights to all, no matter their race, their color or their stature in life...\n\n...but as in all things, justice is never final. To walk the path to a better future is to walk a path without end. There will be those who will try to steer us from the path, and those who insist that we have walked far enough. We must always recognize the fact that the work to better fulfil the promise that our God-given country was founded upon shall never be finished. We must keep walking, keep improving, and keep striving to create a true land of liberty that will shine bright in a world of darkness."\n\nPresident Kennedy smiled even brighter as the crowd applauded. He knew that he could not grow complacent. There were still those who would try to stop him from doing what truly needed to be done. Yet knowing that the majority of America was with him made him all the more resolute in his ambitions. His dream, John's dream, the American Dream would be realised for the sake of those smiling faces before him. He would fight for all of them and fight against any who would stand in his way, and he would do it all gladly, not because it was easy..."

That was all the motivation he needed to steel himself for the coming term.\n\n"Four years ago, I came to you as an insurgent. I stood as a lone voice in resistance against those who would seek to erode our great Anglo-Saxon identity. You, the people of our God-blessed United States, stood up and joined me, and together we secured the future of our culture and our liberty against those who would risk it all in the name of 'progress.' Now, once again you have placed your faith in me, and I vow in the name of God the Almighty that I shall execute your will...\n\n...there are still those among us who would choose to squander the many boons they have been given in the name of naive idealism. I hope that after today they will re-evaluate their position. You and I together have shown them the true will of the people, and our will will not be silenced. In the name of freedom, and in the name of the true American way, we will stand firm against that which would seek to divide us!"\n\nThe crowd roared, equal parts cheers from the front and boos from the back. Countless banners waved furiously in the wind, be they the Stars and Stripes, state flags or the Confederate battle flag. Wallace grinned with pride as he gazed upon the myriad masses who had come from all over to see him. These were the men who had built America with their own hands, the women who had birthed and raised those men, and the children who would one day inherit the American legacy. With them on his side, the path ahead was clear.\n\nIt was time to finish the work."

The crowd before him applauded enthusiastically - many of them lifelong Democrats, some who had been briefly tempted away by the Right-NPP, and some who were new faces. All of them had come to him to lead them for four more years, and it was his good and honorable duty to give them what they wished for. There were some of his actions which many may call callous, but he did it all in the name of making America as strong and self-reliant as it needed to be to stare down the forces of evil lurking overseas.\n\n"The first and only duties of a nation's government must be to oversee the security of its people and to provide a hall in which the voice of the nation can be heard and debated. These past four years, we have worked to return our government to this core directive, shedding away the naivety of well-meaning men who bloated and extended the federal reach with their grandiose designs and passion projects. The true glory of this land lies not in what the government can do, but instead in what its people can do...\n\n...I promise to you, America, that we will continue to stand tall against a world of hatred. Our hearts and minds are stronger than the forces of fascism can ever comprehend. Through rugged determination, ingenuity, wit and cunning, we can continue to be a beacon of light upon this Earth. America is strong, and its people are stronger still, and we must never let our determination to better ourselves ever waver."\n\nGoldwater allowed himself a small smile as the cheers washed over him. He had much to be proud of after all. With a strong military that the fascists would never dare challenge, a responsible people who would look to their own betterment, and a government that would not have the power to take from the people as much as they gave away, he was securing the future of the American nation. It was a future that, if his victory was anything to go by, was one that the people were quite looking forward to."

In four years, he had helped to create a new legacy of spaceflight that had inspired millions of Americans, all while bettering the lot of the people back down on Earth. As he stood before the people once more, he prepared himself for the tasks ahead, in the hopes of taking America to even greater heights.\n\n"These turbulent decades have not been kind to the American nation, yet we have pressed ahead. We have emerged from a time of darkness and uncertainty into a new era of hope, progress and scientific understanding. Ever since the first pilgrims set foot upon these shores, America has been a land of explorers. It is in our blood to go forth into the unknown and find a place for ourselves there. Today, we once more celebrate the spirit of our nation, and affirm that true knowledge and understanding cannot belong to one man alone, but to all men united in the desire of a better world...\n\n...the work cannot stop here. When man first created fire, he endeavored to improve further. He heated his forge and made steel. He boiled steam to drive his engines. He lit a pillar of light under himself and soared into the heavens. Each new discovery brought not only greater opportunities, but also a more bountiful quality of life for all. We too must embody this proud tradition. Our nation will continue to innovate, continue to push the boundaries of what is possible, and all will be made more prosperous for it."\n\nPresident Glenn gazed upwards as the crowd applauded.

Perhaps they couldn't even afford the fare to come to Washington, or the depths of their poverty had made the prospect of working for the day far more important than coming out. Now, they were here. As he finished reciting the oath of office, he surveyed the assembled crowd and saw a people uplifted from their sorrows. The sight alone was more than enough a reward for his work, but he knew that he still had more to do.\n\n"It is often said that a chain is only so strong as its weakest link. So too is a nation only so great as its humblest man. When he and his kindred are stricken, and the nation does not rise to the task of uplifting him, it has effectively split itself in two. It is split between a loud nation of opulence and splendor, and a silent nation of want. For a nation to be great, it must not allow this fractured silence. Four years ago I stood before you and vowed to never allow this silence again, and now you the people stand before me, and you are no longer silent...\n\n...but it is not sufficient for the nation to plaster over the gaps. The cracks must truly be healed, and the inequalities of the nation truly addressed before the spectre can finally be slain. Let us go forth in the interests of the land, and of the people. Let us work to once and for all end want and misery in this country. Let us strive to fulfil the true potential of this nation and allow all to enjoy its bounty.

President Harrington smiled, but he knew that words alone could not move a nation. Four years had been spent doing precisely what he had warned against, his efforts a mere bandage over the wound of want. Now he had four more years, and he had to make them count.

Baltimore, where citizen's anger may have burned the hottest, has concluded its extraordinary use of heavily armed federal troops.\n\nThe protests and riots that broke out over President Nixon's use of the veto against civil rights legislation are slowly starting to die down, as a combination of apathy and repression slows their inertia. As the dust settles, historians and political scientists are examining the possibility that this outpouring of discontent marks the greatest social upheaval since the Civil War. Even as the violence on the street is decreasing rhetorical violence is increasing.\n\nMany Civil Rights moderates are outraged, but are afraid of being tied to the riots by future electoral opponents. A broader swath of opposition, from liberal Republicans to the NPP-Left, are decrying Nixon as the tyrant envisioned by the Founders. An open letter signed by a bevy of top academics castigated the Republican party for falling in with segregationists and cast the veto as the ugly vow of the unholy union between R and D.

Few thought the seventies would be a decade where the Allman Brothers Band were banned from performing in their home state, where the Negro Motorist Green Book would surpass 40 years of publication, and where men and women of separate races still face criminal prosecution for falling in love. Yet, thanks to decades of federal ambivalence to this injustice, and failure to pass a lasting Civil Rights Act, have allowed our nation's greatest shame to endure.\n\nBlack America's fury at their continued oppression has reached a boiling point. With Reverend King and his principles of nonviolent resistance being dead for almost a decade, many Blacks have turned to violence, organized or disorganized, as the only viable form of resistance. Segregated department stores hire armed guards to protect against vandalism, and Southern police have become increasingly militarized in order to quash the near-monthly riots in Black neighborhoods. In reaction, Southern Whites have been flocking to the Ku Klux Klan and other racist militias in order to brutalize Blacks who protest injustice. The Left-NPP declares themselves the only political force who truly fights for racial justice, Yockey claims to be the one man who can save White America from lawlessness, and many take their word for it.\n\nIf America does not make any progress on this crisis, it will only further deteriorate.

Everybody knew enough to make sure they didn't leave the wrong words hanging in the air for the wrong ears: shibboleths sprouted in the smoky mist. The Genovese branch of the Mafia hadn't clung to their yellowed halls of power on the East Coast by playing stupid. They certainly weren't going to start now.\n\nThe struggle at present wasn't one of power, but of its old friend, money. The New York joints had been busted up for a long while, and for a time the patrons had settled for what they could get. Depression years and the chaos of the Fifties had a way of killing any uptown pretensions. But now that America was recovering the old middle-class patrons were beginning to filter out, and ones even the Cosa Nostra deemed distasteful were moving in to take their place.

Beyond the occasional whisper and the wordless glances, not much makes it out of the haze of anonymity, and long may it remain so - the haze is the only thing that separates this part of town from the moralizing glaze of the rest of America. It's the only thing that keeps it safe.\n\nAs I'm writing this, a pair of young men (in their twenties, perhaps?), one Latino, one Caucasian, are swerving to the aching beat of "Satisfaction". Their patterned shoes tap out a rhythm at once familiar and strange; just irregular enough to inject vitality while keeping pace with the beat. Their bodies trace patterns so bold they'd be scandalous anywhere else, but here in the trace of lips and hands on waists it achieves careworn familiarity, like an elderly seamstress fixing an old cardigan. If this had been a different country perhaps they would have become dancers. But the lipstick and the gaudy dresses they wear would kill their careers, and a lot more besides, in this one. America is home to the brave, but this land isn't free, not for some. Not yet.\n\nFor now there is the freedom of the swirl and curve of dance, the celebration of the joy of life in a world with so little else. Another man offers his hand, and I rise to dance. In the gentle rhythm and the smoky swirls I sense some vast and gentle ecstasy, and with every sway I come closer to its source."

But autumn is sweeping in, one chill breeze at a time.\n\nThe signs have been there for a long while; the Mayor's riding on the coattails of the Moral Cleanup movement sweeping the country, and the officers sent to do the collection duties (one calls it the offering bag, with only a hint of irony) from the Inn tell the bartenders of the Anti-Mafia Team they're forming in the back of the Metropolitan Department. It's not like the community they've formed here hasn't known the wrath of the cops, but this time it'll be different. Change is coming to America, as the President says over the airwaves, but some changes are less welcome than others.\n\nThe bartender methodically cleans his cups half an hour before closing time: he'll take care of the mess in the toilets afterwards (and there is always a mess in the toilets). He got hired by the Don same as all the staff, but he's come to love the place. The patrons are gaudy and have a glint in their eyes, but it's a real life they're living here in the damp spaces.\n\nHe looks at a sleeping customer hunched over his cups and smiles wanly.

It's common knowledge that those who get arrested by the Morals Squad as cross-dressing men don't make it out without bruises, spit-drenched faces, manhandling. Men with faces lean and caked with makeup wrestle with their cuffs and spit on their captors.

Growing cheers, growling, shouts of "Gay Power!" echo from the crowds, which have swelled to bursting in the street. Stormé Delarverie falls to the floor struggling against four officers, and all hell breaks loose.\n\nRecords are unclear what exactly happens next: in a wave of anger, the mob pushes over police wagons, hurls bricks at the officers retreating into Stonewall, presses garbage against the broken windows. Many of the most repressed members of the gay community lead the riot - the drag queens and the street boys, leading a wild, wild charge. Sylvia Rivera, notable drag queen, will remember it as "the greatest night of her life". The doors of the Inn are broken open with a battering ram.

Witnesses describe an odd beauty to the refuse-strewn street, like a river of broken toys.\n\nOf course, the streets aren't the only thing breaking the news: all through the next day crowds gawk at the burnt-out shell of Stonewall, and when the next night comes the they are joined by songwriters, poets, activists and tourists washing down the streets in a tide of exuberant energy. Allen Ginsberg notes, on the way back, that "the guys there were so beautiful-they've lost that wounded look that fags all had 10 years ago.""

Though we could not stage direct attacks in the Home Islands nor in China, we have pinpointed various locations where we can start breaking down the Sphere from within. Let's begin with a nation that many of our great-grandfathers are familiar with.\n\nThe Philippines. These islands were the spoils of our victory over the Spanish Empire in 1898, and they stayed with us until the Second World War saw them forcefully ripped away from our influence. The Japanese preyed on the inhabitants ever since, spawning dozens of pro-democratic rebel groups that we could lend aid to. Their close proximity to the Japanese island may prove to be useful if we can get the Filipinos on our side.\n\nVietnam. The Vietnamese have been oppressed since the dawn of French colonialism, and the handing over of Vietnam to Japan only made matters worse for the natives. This could be our opportunity to introduce democracy and let Vietnam be ruled by Vietnamese for the first time in centuries. Vietnam could also be a gateway to India or even China itself if we succeed.\n\nIndonesia. These islands provide a large bulk of the Sphere's resources, mainly oil, rubber, and a hefty worker population. If we operate in Indonesia and persuade them to rebel against their Japanese overlords, the economy of the Sphere would suffer incredible damage. There would be shortages across East Asia, and it may cause other members of the Sphere to renounce their membership, further pressuring the Empire of Japan."

Alternatively, we could choose one of our American carriers to host the talks, and it would give us the upper hand, but the Japanese may be reluctant about our decision.

Both Goldwater and Glenn sought to replace the current President, either by going to the right and appeal to the Democratic wing of the party in the case of Goldwater, or further to the left and the Republicans for Glenn. However, neither managed to get many delegates in the few primaries that were held for the R-Ds, and just as soon as they announced their candidacies, they were forgotten and left on the sidelines.\n\nBut now the President can focus on their eventual opponent in the NPP, and [USA.GetLeader] is secretly hoping that they can win a second term just as easily as he pushed out "AuH20" and "Glenn Rogers" from the nomination."

There are now only two viable candidates in a race that has seen many trying to win the keys to the White House: Arizona Senator and proud firebrand conservative Barry Goldwater, or Ohio Governor and famed astronaut John Glenn.\n\nFor months, in debates on TV and radio, at rally's from coast to coast, and in living rooms and over the dinner tables of everyday Americans, the battle between Barry and John has raged. Pins with their faces, and slogans like "IN YOUR HEART YOU KNOW HE'S RIGHT" and "SOAR TO NEW HEIGHTS WITH GLENN", posters, newspaper ads, cardboard hats and all the memorabilia of a campaign seeking to win the chance to be the R-D standard bearer. Both are claiming that only they can end the anomaly that is the National Progressive Party's [USA.GetLeader] who now sits at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the first non Republican or Democrat to hold the highest office in the land since before the US Civil War over 100 years ago. But before they can focus on the NPP, they have to get the nod at the convention.\n\nBut as the night drags on and ballot after ballot shows little movement between Goldwater and Glenn, finally one of the few "favorite sons" left on the ballot, only there because some delegates hoped against hope that their chosen candidate could serve as a compromise candidate, finally folded.

However, neither won more than a handful of delegates in the primaries, and both were overshadowed by the current President's popularity and leadership within the party.\n\nNow that [USA.GetLeader] has secured the nomination with little in the way of opposition, the plan now is to face the Republican-Democrats, and ensure that the past four years wasn't a fluke in American political history, but the start of a new two party system."

Marshall, a graduate of Howard Law School and an experienced civil rights litigator, would be the first African-American to serve on the highest court in the land. His appointment would surely mark a turning point in American history. However, some in Congress are not so willing to see such a point turn in the first place.\n\nMany Senators come from the South, and are directly reliant on white voter blocs who aren't well-disposed towards putting a black man on the Supreme Court. Several members of the Senate have already put out statements to the press expressing their firm opposition, although nobody has come out and said that it would be due to Marshall's race. Instead, the releases mentioned the dangers of "liberal judicial activism", and other such phrases. Clearly, the appointment of Thurgood Marshall will be a political fight for the ages."

Justice Marshall will be the first African-American to serve on the court, and his confirmation is undoubtedly a victory for the Civil Rights Movement, which he himself has worked tirelessly to advance.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing, a number of conservative senators railed against "judicial activism", and made a variety of statements that many commentators have called little better than dog whistles. Some even asked whether or not Marshall had ties to "American Bolsheviks". This strategy failed, however. At a press conference today, Justice Marshall stated his gratitude to the Senate, and to the people of America, before posing for pictures with his two sons and his wife, the civil rights activist Cecilia Suyat Marshall.\n\nThis is a truly historic moment for the nation, representing the triumph of justice over institutional racism!"

Two weeks ago, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to have Marshall's nomination proceed to the Senate floor, but with the recommendation that it be rejected. This was seen by many as a death knell for the appointment, but still, our whips persisted in trying to gather the necessary votes. They failed. In a tight vote, the Senate rejected Marshall's nomination, led by a large bloc of reactionary southerners.\n\nAs observers sat stunned by the rejection of the man who would have been the first black Supreme Court Justice, some in the White House were already drafting plans for a response. The next name on the shortlist is the fairly conservative Lewis F. Powell, Jr. Let's hope that he makes it."

Demoralized and pressured by their constituents' dissent, councilors from a majority of member-states demand concrete results from their continued cooperation, whether through indicants of mutual benefit or through decisive victories against those adversaries who would wish them harm. These are countered by outspoken rebuttals demanding more equitable contributions to the alliance's military and economic might.\n\nLeft unsaid in this exchange is the ultimate recourse should Washington fail to address either affront."
USA_OFN_Buffs_4:0 "OFN Unity - Middling"
USA_OFN_Buffs_4_desc:0 "The Organization of Free Nations is disunited. Unheeded pleas and lackluster performances have worn off the torch's luster and sown seeds of doubt among once-stalwart proponents. The selfsame have begun to question if the coalition truly is a vehicle for advancing democratic principles, rather than an extension of self-serving American designs. Likewise, more Americans than ever hold reservations over bankrolling other nations' defense when issues at home - healthcare, infrastructure, inequality - better deserve the public's expense."

USA_OFN_Buffs_5_desc:0 "The Organization of Free Nations is slightly disunited. President Dewey had likened the alliance to a "family of democracies"; like any family, it should follow, the OFN quarrels with one another over trivial matters. Arguments involving the household's future - what plans to commit, how much money to spend - erupt from time to time, albeit in amicable fashion.\n\nBy and large, each member-state is content with the current state of affairs. This may change as action and circumstance permit."

USA_OFN_Buffs_7_desc:0 "The Organization of Free Nations is united. Tensions disappear as every member-state finds their own expectations of the alliance not only met, but surpassed through Washington's initiative.

Who shall stand before such awe-inspiring might?"

Its message is simple, yet varied among beholders.\n\nTo the unheard it pledged ears hearing their wailing laments. To the unseen it pledged eyes seeing their hidden truths. To the unspoken it pledged lips shouting their names in every alleyway and boulevard. And to the architects of their suffering - tyrants, strongmen, fascists - it pledged an end to their malevolence.\n\nAn army of free men assembles before an incandescent torch, blazing brighter than ever before. Let the oppressed seek refuge in its homely warmth, and let their oppressors burn before its terrible swift flames!"

#Nixon 
USA_John_F_Kennedy_dep_desc:0 "------------\n§LAs the eldest son of former President Joseph P. Kennedy, John Fitzgerald Kennedy is the heir to a troubled political legacy in America - and has the charisma and bearing to remain unbowed regardless. As one of the last progressive Democrats on the East Coast, Kennedy was a natural political pick for Richard Nixon's presidential ticket in 1960, promising to bring together the dour Republican from California with a charming, progressive East Coast Democrat.\n\nUnfortunately, governing would prove to be a harder challenge than campaigning for both President Nixon and Vice President Kennedy, with the Vice President frequently outshining his superior in public appearances and on Capitol Hill - most recently serving as the President's envoy to the Japanese during the Hawaiian Missile Crisis. The American public's adulation of Kennedy has not endeared him to President Nixon, and the relationship between the two men - and their wings of the party - have cooled noticeably.§!"

USA_John_McCormack_dep_desc:0 "------------\n§LAmerica is going through turbulent times, and John William McCormack is a rock of stability amidst the chaos.\n\nThe sudden and unexpected impeachment of Richard Nixon caused John F. Kennedy to assume office, but the line of command did not end there. Someone had to fill the empty seat left by him, and that someone was the Speaker of the House according to the much-treasured constitution. McCormack himself never had any grand ambitions regarding his future career, but fate takes strange turns sometimes.\n\nLuckily, few people are passionate about their vice president. McCormack is perfectly content to stay in the shadows for now, silently performing his duty until he gets replaced by a man the people voted for. This is how he wants history to remember him - not as a grand reformer or a glorious statesman, but as a man who solemnly fulfilled his duty.§!"

USA_Carl_Hayden_dep_desc:0 "------------\n§LLife can be a curious thing. When Carl Trumbull Hayden got elected president pro tempore of the Senate, he prepared for years of administrative work and political legwork. Him being third in line to succeed the President of the United States was more of a fun fact to him, something he could tell his grandchildren - after all, there is no way that three presidents would leave office in a row, right? Now, two out of three are gone, and Hayden is slowly getting worried.\n\nHayden's apparent reclusiveness when it comes to speaking on the floor of the senate should not be confused with shyness or cowardice. Known as the "Silent Senator", Carl Hayden is famous for winning friends and influencing people in committee meetings and cloakroom encounters. A colleague of him once claimed that "no man in Senate history wields more influence with less oratory", and perhaps these kinds of legislative abilities are exactly what John McCormack needs to enable a gradual return to normalcy.§!"

USA_William_P_Rogers_pol_desc:0 "------------\n§LWilliam Rogers can be said to be one of the few men in President Nixon's cabinet to have been appointed specifically for their lack of expertise in their portfolio - as a way for the President himself to dominate foreign policy. While Rogers is a talented and respected legal mind - serving as President Eisenhower's Attorney General - President Nixon has repeatedly expressed his interest in leading foreign policy personally, and without influence from within the R-D's. Rogers has served as an uninspired Secretary of State to date, frequently overruled or even kept out of the loop by President Nixon.§!"

USA_Robert_McNamara_eco_desc:0 "------------\n§LRobert McNamara is an outside appointment in President Nixon's cabinet - coming from industry rather than the political class. A veteran of the Army Air Force during World War II, McNamara entered government after over a decade of service as one of the Ford Motor Company's 'Whiz Kids' - turning the company around through the revolutionary application of a statistical and scientific approach to management and business. In poaching McNamara from his position as President of Ford in 1960, Nixon hopes to transplant McNamara's methods from the boardrooms of Detroit to the smoke-filled rooms of Washington D.C.\n\nNixon offered McNamara a choice between the Defense and Treasury portfolios - and while McNamara is officially Secretary of the Treasury, he frequently weighs in on issues of defense, building a network of connections that could see him rise higher in Washington, should he so desire...§!"

USA_Melvin_Laird_mil_desc:0 "------------\n§LMelvin Laird is a respected congressman from Wisconsin, having served in Congress since 1953 as a member of the House Appropriations Committee specializing in defense budget and procurement issues. Though well-versed in defense affairs - advocating for a gradual reorientation of American force structure to support a defensive posture with OFN allies - Laird continually fights to defend his portfolio against Nixon's Secretary of the Treasury, Robert McNamara, who pushes for a more statistical and results-driven approach to a more assertive defense policy.\n\nFinding his own position in question in the Nixon administration and with his talents increasingly used purely for Congressional affairs, Laird has expressed his desire to run again for the House of Representatives in 1964, potentially setting up a race to succeed him in the Nixon Administration.§!"

#Bennett
USA_Gerald_Ford_dep_desc:0 "------------\n§LVice President Gerald Ford was largely unknown outside Washington in 1964 - but, among Washington's powerbrokers, his selection as President Bennett's running mate came as little surprise. Leveraging a decorated record of military service in WWII to win a seat in the House of Representatives from Michigan, Ford eschewed the publicity stunts or blatant politicking of many of his colleagues, instead serving as one of the key go-betweens within the Republican-Democratic Party in the years after its merger - earning a reputation as a 'Congressman's congressman' in the process.\n\nAs a respected military officer with over a decade of service in the House and with a sterling reputation for integrity and fairness among his colleagues, Ford was a natural fit to Bennett's promise of stability and reconciliation after the tumultuous Nixon years. Ford's support for civil rights and liberalism also helped seal Bennett's support in the North, despite his fiscal conservatism being more in line with Bennett's own views.§!"

USA_Edmund_Muskie_pol_desc:0 "------------\n§LSome say that international politics is a cutthroat business, where only the fierce and ruthless survive. Others claim that it's a highly delicate affair, where only careful and risk-averse diplomats can avoid the worst possible outcome.\n\nEdmund Muskie can be both.\n\nAs a Maine-born son of Polish immigrants, Muskie always had an affinity for forging bridges between different cultures. His political career is marked by a strong showing of bipartisanship and an unshakable belief in the United States and her military - being one of the first sitting Senators to publicly support an intervention in the South African war, Muskie's dedication to a strong and bold foreign policy is a continuation of his long-lasting history of interventionism and antifascism. Despite this apparent jingoism, Muskie has also been a vocal proponent of partial denuclearization. One has to wonder if this differentiated world view was what moved Bennett to nominate him as his Secretary of State, as his administration is a clear statement against extremism and fundamentalism. Muskie's term is set right in the middle of perhaps the most turbulent times since WW2, and history will be the judge if Bennett's decision was the correct one.§!"

USA_Absalom_Robertson_eco_desc:0 "------------\n§LSecretary of the Treasury Absalom Robertson is a lawyer by training and a experienced legislator in his own right - but with hardly the finance or business experience that would suggest he would be a fit for running the Treasury. But like much of the Bennett Administration, Robertson's appointment to a high position in the Cabinet reflects a recognition of political reality.\n\nThe R-Ds remain, fundamentally, a coalition of two different parties operating in different parts of the United States, and Robertson's devout Christianity, his connections to Virginia's Byrd Organization, and his conservative stance on Civil Rights all proved essential in fighting the '64 election in the South. And for his efforts, Robertson and his wing of Democrats have been rewarded handsomely - being tasked with designing and implementing the Silver Act, a major shift in American economic policy aimed at ending the country's postwar malaise.§!"

USA_Clark_Clifford_mil_desc:0 "------------\n§LFew systems can be considered to be as fine and complex as the political machine in Washington, and quite a lot of hopeful reformers were rendered entirely ineffective due to their lack of experience with the inner mechanics of the Capitol and its surroundings. The conglomeration of interest groups, lobbyists, personal feuds and utter absurdities transpiring in the Capitol may be completely incomprehensible to the average human mind, but Clark Clifford is thoroughly clairvoyant when it comes to federal politicking.\n\nHailing from Kansas, Clifford has been involved in legal matters for decades. After acquiring a law degree and practicing for a few years in St. Louis, he decided to enter politics during the aftermath of WWII after witnessing the structural failures of the then-dominant system. He served in numerous posts under a wide variety of presidents, and over the years, he acquired an astonishing base of knowledge that's sure to benefit Bennett and his ambitious agenda for America.§!"

#Johnson
USA_Edmund_Muskie_dep_desc:0 "------------\n§LEdmund Sixtus Muskie cuts an unusual figure as one of the leading champions of liberalism within the Democratic Party in New England, when many other Democrats come from the South or the more conservative Midwestern states. A pugnacious and combative legislator, Muskie and then-Senator Johnson had more than their fair share of clashes on the Senate floor in the 1950's. However, his commitment to advancing civil rights and American liberalism - much like the late John F. Kennedy - made him the natural running mate for President Johnson, a Democrat he could count on to advance the vision of the Great Society.\n\nBeyond his accumulated experience in the Senate and its Northern members, Muskie is also a passionate advocate for environmental causes, often claiming to supporters that he would pick up the mantle of Theodore Roosevelt's conservation efforts - a claim that won him some support in the West, but has met more skepticism in Washington as the President advances his other priorities.§!"

USA_Dean_Rusk_pol_desc:0 "------------\n§LThe world is an unfriendly place. Holding hands and singing Kumbaya is simply not an effective method to stem the ever looming threat of fascism - only an uncompromising diplomacy backed by a well-oiled military can stand up to the dictators in Tokyo and Germania.\n\nDean Rusk is poised to reassert America's status as the only bastion of freedom on an international stage. Born into a lower-class family, he climbed the ladder at an incredibly high pace, rising from the son of a sharecropper to perhaps the most important member of Johnson's cabinet. His bold stance on foreign policy may be the necessary antidote to the creeping sprawl of imperialism, although there remains a lingering fear of what might happen if his gutsy approach to diplomacy backfires.§!"

USA_Henry_Fowler_eco_desc:0 "------------\n§LHenry Fowler brings a lifetime's worth of experience in law, public policy, and financial affairs to the Johnson Administration, despite never having held elected office of his own. Following his graduation from Yale Law School in 1932, Fowler is best known for having defended the constitutionality of public works programs to combat the Great Depression, and then for serving as a senior legal advisor to the War Production Board during WWII, gaining familiarity with the business of how America built and paid for its war machine.\n\nFollowing America's defeat, Fowler became a key member of the Eisenhower administration after the merger of the Republican and Democratic parties, leveraging his experience in the war to oversee the linking of the newly-founded OFN's economic and military policies. Now, after nearly twenty years in government, President Johnson has called on Fowler to provide a steady hand at the Treasury - which will surely be needed, if the cost of Johnson's Great Society are anywhere near as high as estimated...§!"

USA_Robert_McNamara_mil_desc:0 "------------\n§LRobert McNamara is an unusual holdover appointment from Richard Nixon's cabinet - shifting laterally from his position as Secretary of the Treasury to Defense. Given President Johnson's stated focus on improving America at home, the going assumption is that President Johnson is willing to keep the business of national defense in proven hands - and McNamara had already been involved in defense issues beyond his portfolio during the Nixon years.\n\nWith the appointment of Henry Fowler to the Treasury, President Johnson has handed control over the budget and defense to experienced technocrats, with the clear expectation that they will take care of business while Johnson remakes America. McNamara, no doubt, is capable and willing to serve Johnson as he did Nixon - but with his growing network of connections in Washington, McNamara is now a political fixture in his own right, and some whisper that his ambition may soon extend to the White House itself.§!"

#RFK
USA_Hubert_Humphrey_dep_desc:0 "------------\n§LFew people are as qualified for their job as Hubert Humphrey, vice president of the United States of America.\n\nHumphrey has been in politics for decades, and his entire career is one big progressive accomplishment after another. He founded the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party and laid the groundwork for turning the state into the bastion of social democracy it is today, he founded the Peace Corps to aid the most vulnerable nations, and he has always been a strict antifascist willing to go as far as to jail those who wish to subvert the republic with their toxic ideology. It is said that the vice president is only one heartbeat away from the highest office - and if something terrible would happen, Hubert Humphrey would be a more than suitable replacement for Robert F. Kennedy.§!"

USA_Claude_Pepper_pol_desc:0 "------------\n§LAmerica aims to be the lighthouse in a sea of fascism, the guiding light helping the few remaining free nations to navigate through the dark waves. The keeper of this proverbial lighthouse is no one other than Clause Pepper, the current Secretary of State. \n\nPepper's career is peppered with groundbreaking achievements, such as being one of the youngest senators to ever take office and being a trailblazer when it comes to fighting for labor and the elderly. His foreign policy is marked by his bold anti-fascist ideology, which extends not only to the US itself or her sphere of influence, but the entire world instead. Anti-american ideologies simply do not belong on this planet, and Claude Pepper is set to ensure that even the smallest microstates stay far away from allying with the Germans.§!"

USA_Maurine_Neuberger_eco_desc:0 "------------\n§LWhen people hear "Secretary of Treasury", they usually don't imagine a female teacher with a Bachelor of Arts - and yet, Maurine Neuberger defied all expectations and made history by becoming the first woman holding one of the most important offices of the United States.\n\nHer climb to the top has been a long and arduous one. Coming from an unassuming middle class family, she lived a normal life teaching high school kids until she met the love of her life, Richard Neuberger. As a senator, he had the political connections she needed to kickstart her own career - and due to her incredible talent, she rose through the ranks at a breakneck speed. In 1950, she became a representative, in 1960 a senator, and in 1964, she got invited to be a member of Robert F. Kennedy's cabinet. The future is bright for Maurine Neuberger, and many are already convinced that her illustrious career won't stop here.§!"

USA_Henry_Mucci_mil_desc:0 "------------\n§LIn dark times like these, it takes a hero to shatter the enduring malaise and revitalize the eternal American spirit. Henry Andrews Mucci fits that archetype to a T - his daring liberation of a prisoner camp back in the Scottish theatre sparked the hope that the war could be turned around after all, and even though it wasn't enough to turn the tides, it still created a legend that lives on to this day.\n\nBorn into an Italian immigrant family with ten children, Mucci never had any success handed to him. His career is nothing but decades of dutiful work for the United States, and his nomination by Robert F. Kennedy signifies that personal courage is still something to be rewarded in America.§!"

#Thurmond
USA_Spiro_Agnew_pol_desc:0 "------------\n§LAmerica has always prided itself on honesty, both in domestic affairs and in regards to foreign policy. It was a nation that valued its allies and honored all treaties and pacts, no matter how they might benefit or damage the position of the US. The world was a dark and wretched place, but America was a beacon of integrity among the darkness, proving that humanity still has a place in diplomacy.\n\nNow look where that got them.\n\nSpiro Theodore Agnew is not afraid of fighting fire with fire. America has no friends, just interests - and these interests constantly change, shifting in response to the tides of international politics. A nation that supports everything America stands for can be dropped in an instant, as long as the situation demands it.\n\nSome might call it heartless. Agnew calls it pragmatic.§!"

He never ran for office, nor did he publicly take a political position in his life. He certainly isn't a segregationist like Thurmond, and would have happily used the army to enforce desegregation had previous Presidents given him the order. He accepted Thurmond's request to fill Humphrey's office, but still struggles to comprehend why Thurmond would want an apolitical airborne cavalry commander to preside over the US Senate.\n\nYet, perhaps a man with no political ambition is exactly the sort of piece Thurmond needs on his side of the board. Taylor doesn't understand Thurmond's political goals, nor does he try to figure them out. He is grateful for the prestige of the position, and will gladly vote as Thurmond requires when tie-breaking is needed. Like a rook castling a king, Taylor can make his master safer and give him a slight edge in the game of politics. Soon, Taylor may cast the decisive vote that fulfills Thurmond's ultimate ambition.§!"

America is under attack on all fronts, and intentionally restraining the military to please hippies, journalists, and other useless people is a luxury it cannot afford. These leeches might be concerned about the fact that a former member of the house who advocated for the use of nuclear weapons in the South Africa war is now directly responsible for the administration of the military, but what do they know? Rivers surely knows more about the matter than some limp-wristed boys, and besides, even the smallest nuke has to be authorised by Thurmond himself anyways.\n\nLuckily, not everything has to be signed off by the big man in the oval office. Minor incidents such as a few soldiers going a little overboard whilst liberating a village are obviously not important enough to land on the president's desk, and Rivers is poised to ensure that these internal affairs stay within the Department of Defense, where they can be classified and shelved until everyone involved is dead for at least fifty years.§!"

USA_Curtis_LeMay_dep_desc:0 "------------\n§LIt is unsurprising that a man that has already influenced the Cold War as much as Curtis LeMay finds himself in a leading role again. Responsible for developing the US Air Force's nuclear doctrine during his leadership of Strategic Air Command, LeMay's tenure as Chief of the Air Force was significantly less influential due to constant conflict with Vice President Kennedy and General Maxwell Taylor. His request to bomb Japanese missile sites in Hawaii was sternly denied, and led to ostracization followed by an extremely public resignation during the Guyana intervention.\n\nLeMay's fire did not diminish on the campaign trail, stating America was capable of "bombing Africa back to the Stone Age" and becoming a major headache for the Wallace campaign. Since the beginning of the campaign he has remained notably silent on almost every issue not related to national security. If Wallace's turbulent presidency ends suddenly, it is anyone's guess what policies his successor would enact.§!"

USA_J_William_Fulbright_pol_desc:0 "------------\n§LIf George Wallace is the personification of firebrand Southern populist politics, then J. William Fulbright embodies the South at its most genteel. A Rhodes Scholar, former university president, and the son of two of Arkansas' captains of finance, Fulbright is educated, cosmopolitan, well-connected, and far more comfortable at a state dinner than a state fair.\n\nFulbright is the OFN's staunchest advocate, and perhaps the world's last true believer in a multilateral international order. Fulbright envisions America as the guiding light for the free world, the last beacon of liberty in a sea of tyranny. He supports funding student exchange programs between the United States and other nations and spoke up in defense of these programs when they were criticized during the Grey Scare. Fulbright wants the OFN to expand its membership, even to nations following dramatically different ideologies, and forge a friendlier and more peaceable world.\n\nYet, Fulbright is still a Dixiecrat. He broke with the Democratic Party when Thurmond led the exodus in the wake of Brown v. Board. He voted against Nixon's Civil Rights Act after trying to filibuster it. He is a proud member of the Far-Right bloc, and campaigned vigorously for Wallace in his home state. If Fulbright sees a contradiction between being a champion of peace and international cooperation abroad and defending Jim Crow at home, he doesn't show it. In that respect, there is no better choice than him to be Wallace's Secretary of State.§!"

USA_Wilbur_Mills_eco_desc:0 "------------\n§LWilbur Mills was a natural pick for Wallace's Treasury Secretary. As a county judge, he set up a county-funded healthcare plan for the poor in his home state of Arkansas. As chairman of the House's Ways and Means Committee, the former banker was an expert in the tax code and a master of balancing fiscal conservatism with humanitarian goals. As a segregationist and one of Thurmond's Dixiecrat defectors to the NPP, Mills naturally falls into alignment with Wallace's social policies. Moreover, he is the strongest supporter and chief architect of Wallace's Social Security and Medicare initiatives. If anyone can find room in the budget to help the little guy, it's Mills.\n\nOutside of Mills' political life, the man is an enigma. His intense secrecy about his personal life has fueled rumors of binge drinking and wild parties with the Beltway's sultriest strippers. Whatever the truth of these rumors, Wallace will have to keep an eye on Mills and make sure he doesn't drag this administration into a torrid scandal.§!"

The former Senator got his start in politics as an organizer for the Ku Klux Klan, and it was the Grand Dragon of West Virginia who mentored him to run for office. Byrd would earn a reputation as a vitriolic segregationist; he attempted to filibuster the 1962 Civil Rights Act by speaking for a full 14 hours. He once wrote that, "Rather I should die a thousand times and see Old Glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels, a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds.§!"\n\nFor some time, there had been rumors that Byrd was tempering his segregationist views to move closer to the political mainstream. All hopes of that were dashed as he doubled down on his segregationist politics following the election of George Wallace. In contrast to more moderate voices like Fulbright or Mills, Byrd has gone "all-in" on racial segregation. This has earned him a post in Wallace's cabinet, and he has used his new position to become Jim Crow's top advocate in the Executive Branch. With racial politics that are just barely to the left of Yockey's American National Vanguard, Byrd is sure to hold Wallace's feet to the fire if he doesn't go through with repealing the Civil Rights Act.§!"

Rockefeller is more than an empty suit - ever since his governorship of New York, he has been an untarnished paragon of liberalism within the Republican-Democrat party. He would be the first one to put his foot down if Goldwater stept over the line, no matter what the repercussions may be.

Instead of wasting his valuable time on irrelevant conflicts, he does whatever is necessary to strengthen America's position on an international stage. At Ford, he was pivotal in transforming the corporation into the fine-tuned highly efficient machine it is today - and now, he intends to apply his principles to the military of the United States.

After working to pay his way through both his undergraduate and law degrees, Javits entered politics in the 1930's with the Republicans in order to reject Tammany Hall's machine politics in New York - doing so with aplomb in the wave of Republican victories following WWII.\n\nAfter transitioning from the House to the Senate in the late 1950's, Javits found himself serving alongside the equally liberal Nelson Rockefeller. Despite their vastly different upbringings, Javits and Rockefeller worked exceptionally effectively as a team, and both were quick to welcome John Glenn to politics. President Glenn repaid Javits for his support by nominating him as Secretary of the Treasury - leaving the high offices of state in capable hands as Glenn prepares to take America back to the stars.§!"

The rapid development of the military-industrial complex outpaced the rather traditional national security apparatus of the United States, but a new generation of technocrats like Cyrus Roberts Vance is poised to tackle this issue and reforge the proverbial shield of America.\n\nStemming from the private sector, Vance was only tangentially involved in politics until 1957, at which point he got appointed to work for the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services. His tenure has been rather effective, if a bit unremarkable, but one achievement of his garnered the attention of John Glenn - his participation was instrumental in the drafting process of the NASA act, which established the aforementioned agency.\n\nDue to his rather earthly position, Vance is no longer involved with space exploration. However, he's still a big proponent of rocket science - his novel concept of national security involves leveraging total thermonuclear supremacy as the ultimate deterrent against aggressive foreign actions. \n\nHistory will either remember him as an innovative pioneer, or it won't remember him at all.§!"

Howe spent his entire life as an influential advocate for democratic socialism, paving the way for the success of quite a few left-wing politicians like Harrington himself. His contributions to socialist newspapers such as the Partisan Review were instrumental in radicalizing young people with nothing more than a fleeting interest in politics, and his involvement in organizations like the Independent Socialist League ensured that the unfocused actionism of these freshly minted activist got funneled into a highly efficient network with nationwide sway.\n\nHowe and Harrington have been close friends for years, and these two leading the nation together is a natural development of their long and fruitful relationship. They won the election, and now they are about to face their greatest challenge yet - the administration of the United States of America.§!"

His foreign policy experience can be charitably described as lacking, but his vision for a global community united against fascism was promising enough for Harrington to offer him a spot in his newly formed cabinet. \n\nThe political establishment may sneer like they always do, but Fraser is convinced that he knows better. It's up to him to prove that a complete outsider can do a better job at directing a nuclear superpower than some career politicians more concerned about the state of their own careers than the state of the planet. Some might call him inexperienced - and for a good reason, at that - but Fraser merely describes himself as untainted, not influenced by the ivory tower residents from Washington.§!"

Winter, a highly decorated WWII veteran, has a long history of attempting to end the racial divide between black and white soldiers. During his service as an officer during the Philippines campaign, he distinguished himself by being one of the few white officers who treated their black subordinates as more than disposable cannon fodder. This drew the ire of quite a few of his peers, who viewed that as a crass and obscene violation of traditional military protocols - but eventually, history proved Winter right, as Harrington noticed his long list of accomplishments and decided to offer him a spot in his cabinet.\n\nThe people might support the Harrington administration, but the military is still torn about whether to support or to oppose an actively left-wing politician.

This advice paid off for him when he was selected and elected as the party's candidate for Governor of Maryland. Having run against a segregationist Democrat, Agnew's administration was marked by improvements in Civil Rights legislation, making him one of the most liberal members of the Right wing. However, Agnew's compulsive love of order and visceral hatred of protests drove him to publicly berate the movement's leaders, endearing him to many a white southerner.\n\nThis record gave him a simultaneous appeal to both the Northern and Southern wings of the party, leading to his unexpected selection as compromise candidate for Vice President. Spurred on by his speechwriter, Patrick Buchannan, Agnew deviated to right-wing populism during the campaign trail, making a number of racially charged remarks against the Japanese and Polish. Since then, Agnew's political status has soared, being seen by many in the right as the defender of "suburban ethnic" interests with his regular attacks on hippies, socialists, the Japanese, the liberal press, and all other "nattering nabobs of negativism.§!" Not all is rhetoric, however, and Agnew's value to President Smith lies primarily on his ability to achieve congressional compromises, particularly on the ever contentitious matter of Civil Rights.§!"

With a heart with no holes to bleed and a mind composed of little more than sharp wit and hard pragmatism, Kirkpatrick has rocketed herself to the position of Secretary of State for the Smith Administration.\n\nWhile, at face value, she seems an obvious choice for Smith's anti-Japanese positions, Kirkpatrick's appointment was actually a matter of some debate. Kirkpatrick, to put it mildly, takes anti-fascist and anti-Japanese doctrines to a whole new level. She advocates what is now commonly being called the "Kirkpatrick Doctrine": a geopolitical precept that America should support friendly dictatorships in order to prevent the spread of Nazi totalitarianism. This hawkish stance, advocated by some members of the NPP like Scoop Jackson, has occasionally put her at odds with the president. With such extreme views, one wonders how far Kirkpatrick will go to further them, at home and abroad.§!"

When Smith was elected President in 1968, Stennis was the obvious choice to ensure Cabinet unity within Far Right - a man who would bolster Smith's credentials with the South and the expertise to carefully manage her ambitious military reforms at the Pentagon.§!"

Some called him mad, but the number of IJN vessels he sent to the bottom of the Pacific helped him drown out that noise.\n\nAs Jackson's Secretary of Defense, he has championed the Navy's role in nuclear deterrence. He is active in promoting the mass deployment of submarine-launched ballistic missiles and as Chief of Naval Operations he proposed the 41 for Freedom initiative: The commissioning of 41 nuclear-armed submarines who can strike any nation from any sea undetected. His hawkish background and nuclear ambitions have brought him into conflict with Secretary of State Frank Church, and this inter-cabinet tension will be a continuing challenge for the Jackson administration.§!"

USA_Sam_Yorty_dep_desc:0 "------------\n§LSam Yorty is a man of many names. His supporters call him the Maverick Mayor, his opponents call him Suitcase Sam, others go with Shoot-From-The-Lip Sam, and some just stick with Mayor Sam. Regardless of what you call him, it is virtually guaranteed that you'll never forget his name - few modern politicians are as infamous as this legendary former mayor of Los Angeles.\n\nDespite his Californian history and attitude, Yorty was actually born in Nebraska, only moving to the golden state after finishing high school. This, however, barely phazed his career, as he was elected to the State Assembly less than ten years later. The following two decades were spent meandering in committees and vaguely pandering to the left-wing of the party while simultaneously stoking racial tensions until 1960, at which point he finally hit his big break by acquiring mayorship of Los Angeles, the city of angels.\n\nHis glorious, scandal-filled leadership is simply too big, too overwhelming to be summarized in a single paragraph. All that needs to be said is that Sam Yorty is an incredibly colorful personality sure to shake up the dusty office of the Vice President of the United States.§!"

USA_Walt_Rostow_pol_desc:0 "------------\n§LWalt Rostow is the embodiment of Kirkpatrick's bold foreign policy. His unapologetic stance on international anti-fascism caused him to be a divisive figure in both academic and political circles, and his long history of serving the US in a wide variety of global conflicts provided him with the ample experience he needs to translate the Kirkpatrick doctrine into practice. Over the past few years, fascism has slowly creeped forwards and claimed a multitude of previously neutral nations. Rostow is poised to put a hard stop to this, using all tools at his disposal to do so.\n\nBorn into a socialist family in New York, few expected him to become one of the leading hardliners in terms of foreign policy. Rostow fought against Germany twice - once in Scotland and once in South Africa - and if he had to, he'd go for a third round. His conviction to bid fascism in the bud is unshakable, no matter where or how it arises.§!"

USA_Caspar_Weinberger_eco_desc:0 "------------\n§LAt a first glance, Caspar Willard Weinberger's profile appears to be the one of a Secretary of State or a National Security advisor. Born in San Francisco, his life has always been closely interwoven with the military of the US - during his illustrious military career, he worked directly under Douglas McArthur in his intelligence staff and was instrumental in several operations that nearly changed the tides of the war.\n\nHowever, Weinberger is no one-trick pony either. As a Harvard law graduate, he led the California National Progressive Party and transformed it into the competitive powerhouse it is today. His tenure as it's chairman is oftentimes cited as a masterfully executed bout of political maneuvering, and perhaps this shrewd intelligence was what moved Kirkpatrick to offer him a spot in her cabinet.§!"

USA_John_McCain_Jr_mil_desc:0 "------------\n§LJohn McCain's position on military affairs can be summarized with a single lyric - "Bomb, Bomb, Bomb, Bomb, Bomb Indonesia", which he recited live on television whilst explaining his hardline stance on a possible American intervention in Indonesian civil war. Mixing open jingoism with sincere care and appreciation of his troops, his nomination to Kirkpatrick's cabinet was well received among the military of the United States, although certain people are rather concerned about what the ramifications of his policy goals may be.\n\nThe life of the famous South African war veteran is unlike any other. Born on a military base in Panama and entering the USNA as soon as he could, McCain's life is defined by an undying loyalty towards America and her military. His service in the South Africa war and subsequent years spent as a POW forged his conviction that fascism is a plague that has to be eradicated at all costs, no matter how and where.\n\n"I hate the krauts. I will hate them as long as I live.§!" - John McCain.§!"

USA_Louis_Byers_dep_desc:0 "------------\n§LSometimes, it takes the likes of a great speaker to rally the masses and assume power. Sometimes, it's the master bureaucrat, capable of sliding any piece of law into the heart of the nation, no matter how many hurdles are in the way. Sometimes, it's the powerful likes of the soldier-politician, calling for a stronger nation than ever before. And, sometimes, it just takes someone who fancies themselves a writer.\n\nLous T. Byers was certainly not the expected choice of power within the government of President Francis Parker Yockey and his American National Vanguard, but the current cabinet thanks their stars for Byers' position. Establishing his fervent support of Francis Parker Yockey upon the campuses of America across the country after years of supporting George Wallace, Byers' name came to the limelight after continuous writings to newspapers across the country, defending now-Secretary Revilo P. Oliver's postulation about the potential Judeo-Bolshevik conspiracy which led to President John F. Kennedy's assassination. Brought forward as someone who understands the spirit of the Vanguard, President Yockey set his ardent-fan as his running mate, and now he sits as the chief position of government, behind President Yockey himself.\n\nLuckily, however, Byers has managed to find friends throughout the cabinet, despite the rising tensions from within. Byers has taken himself to be a form of a translator for President Yockey, whose academic rhetoric tends to blow far above the understanding of much of America, as he attempts to popularize the National Socialist values of President Yockey in a digestible format for the American populace. What matters now is if the American public will take to enjoying Byers' reconstructed understandings of President Yockey's statements...or will they end up shooting the messenger?"

USA_Revilo_Oliver_pol_desc:0 "------------\n§LDr. Revilo Pendelton Oliver has come far in the past ten years. A cofounder of the John Birch Society in 1958 and long time professor of philology at the University of Illinois, Oliver has become more famous for his anti-Semitic and white nationalist articles than his academic merit. The most notable of these articles, "Marxmanship in Dallas", postulates that John Kennedy was victim of a Judeo-Communist conspiracy and caused Oliver to break with the majority of his conservative colleagues.\n\nUndissauded by this setback, Dr. Oliver claimed that the Birch Society was operated by a "committee of Jews" and fully committed himself to the American National Vanguard, a rising faction of the NPP lead by fellow academic Francis Yockey. Oliver's fervent anti-Semitism has earned him a prize spot in the cabinet, though his distaste for religion as a whole has been played down. Now, Oliver faces the task of creating new relationships with the remains of the Western nations. It is left to his expertise to determine whether America will succeed in bending the OFN to the will of the ANV, or flounder into uncertainty.§!"

USA_Harold_Thompson_eco_desc:0 "------------\n§LFor a party so focused on the conspiracies of "Jewish financiers", it is ironic that such a secretive businessman with foreign intelligence ties was selected for the position of Secretary of the Treasury. With ties to much of the right wing of the NPP and the primary force behind the rise of the American National Vanguard, Thompson has worked to bring about change in America since the day of his recruitment as a Sicherheitsdienst agent at the young age of 18.\n\nFirst coming to prominence with his controversial article "I am an American Fascist," at the height of the Grey Scare, Thompson used his money to rise to a position of great influence within the NPP. Latching onto rising support for the ideas of Francis Yockey, Thompson has wormed his way into the cabinet, determined to eliminate the influence of market-distorters, secure the financial institutions of America, and keep a copy of every report for his handlers in Germania.§!"

USA_John_Crommelin_mil_desc:0 "------------\n§LThroughout the likes of the American National Vanguard, one can find some of the most academic and well-educated minds of America's far-right, ranging from authors to professors to their very own students. However, to exclude the common man of the far-right's voice from politics would be a mistake; thus, we find the strongman, Admiral "Bomb-Run John" G. Crommelin serving as Secretary of Defense within the Presidency of Francis Parker Yockey.\n\nBorn within the heart of the American South in Montgomery, Alabama, Crommelin was raised amidst a heavily military family filled with his five brothers, as each had graduated United States Naval Academy of Annapolis, Maryland, and all had been called to serve in the chaos of the Second World War. A heart of steel and fire drove John G. Crommelin throughout the war, as his service as a naval aviator earned him a reputation of courage and skillfulness, before taking command of officership and beginning to rise through the ranks of the Navy. However, as the onset news of several of his brothers' deaths at the hands of the Japanese in the Pacific War, one streak bore a hole into Crommelin's heart, one which he would never escape throughout the war: hatred. Rage enveloped him in his warfare, as his daringness continued even within the losses of America during the war, and would shift towards the government, as they implemented further favorability towards the Air Force, and began implementing further civilian control over the Navy. John G. Crommelin's dissatisfaction, strongmanism, and southern-gentlemenliness would drive him to the likes of politics, eventually being picked up by Francis Parker Yockey as a potentially very useful asset in his representation of the far-right. Crommelin's dreams became realized as he retained control over the armed forces of the United States as Secretary of Defense.\n\nHowever, all is not dreamlike for Crommelin, or his attitude with the rest of the current administration. His furious hatred towards Hitler and the Nazis of Germany puts him in a fierce opposition towards many others in the Vanguard, for his belief in their aid towards Japan's murder of his brothers. Only time may tell how Crommelin will bear the stresses of the environment, however, one thing is for sure: the military has never seen such a wrathful fist driving its helm before.§!"

#Hall

USA_Paul_Robeson_dep_desc:0 "------------\n§LGus Hall distinguished himself from past presidents by disregarding party compromises and political expertise when creating his Cabinet. The unionist's vision of America awaited not the servants of repressive, antediluvian institutions, he proclaimed, but dreamers with foresight and revolutionary zeal. With this in mind, his campaign searched high and low for a running mate exemplifying both.\n\nEnter Paul Leroy Robeson: film actor, All-American footballer, civil rights activist, and now the first African-American Vice President in history. The Princeton graduate served as the kinder, more educated contrast to the workingman Hall and his rhetoric, winning hearts with baritone-lacquered promises of an America that pays more than lip service to its principal values. Party fears over the untested "two-tone ticket" were summarily dashed by its upset victory in 1972, won in large part by black votes Robeson's presence had mobilized.\n\nYet talent mattered little before sickness and old age. Having barely fought down double pneumonia in 1965, the 72 year-old's health has only dwindled in the years since. Many worry that the aging vice president will spend more of his four years in a sickbed than in office; critics insinuate that President Hall considers Robeson's inevitable absence a prerequisite for his wide-reaching ambitions...§!"

USA_Alger_Hiss_pol_desc:0 "------------\n§LAs a man, Alger Hiss was equal parts brilliant and unpleasant. The long-time president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace combined minute-detail knowledge of every left-wing government and movement on Earth with obnoxious, condescending apologia thereof. Diplomats and officials learned not to spend a minute more than necessary around the former federal attorney; he often returned the favor by addressing his guests exactly a minute after their patience had worn thin.\n\nBut as a policymaker, the Harvard Law graduate was an avowed leftist with years of experience in public service: a rare breed within American foreign policy's establishment. His eager appeals to support socialist dissidents in Asia and Latin America eventually caught the attention of Washington's increasingly sympathetic politicos. Insiders prognosticated for Hiss a place in President Hall's Cabinet; by Inauguration Day, he was formally sworn in as Secretary of State.\n\nLeftists abroad may rejoice in knowing that the Arsenal of Democracy now expresses its formal support for the world proletariat's struggle. Meanwhile, anonymous sources hint that Hiss's prosecutorial finesse contributed to his appointment as much as his discreet connections to foreign socialists...§!"

Losing three fingers to an Alaskan cannery barely hampered Pitong Daliri, or "Seven Fingers", in his own war on poverty; by the Nixon administration's twilight years, press cameras captured the man and his iconic cigar wherever workers expressed their solidarity.\n\nGus Hall's victory meant that high office was a certainty for the veteran striker. Yet few foresaw his appointment as Secretary of the Treasury, a title once reserved for the who's who of bourgeois capitalism. With the federal government at his disposal, Itliong will preside over the first critical years of America's transfiguration into a land not just of liberty and justice, but of bread and roses too.§!"

USA_William_Martin_mil_desc:0 "------------\n§LWilliam Hamilton Martin had few friends in Darwin and even fewer friends in the Pentagon. In fact he was as far away from the levers of American government as a naval intelligence officer can reasonably get, having been stationed in Australia for over a decade. Were it not for his supposed sympathies to domestic left-wing movements - rumors exacerbated by the multiple disciplinary actions he had accrued for disobedience "on moral grounds" - the glorified bureaucrat would have spent the rest of his career as one federal employee among many.\n\nOne can imagine his surprise when President Gus Hall offered Secretary of Defense out of the blue. Accepting it catapulted Martin into the Beltway overnight, with rank and stature high above the vast majority of his now-erstwhile superiors. But Hall's caveats were cryptic and disconcerting: Martin must uphold justice, he said, before the war profiteers and war criminals within his new bailiwick.\n\nIn the coming months, the Washington native will learn his exact place within the Hall administration... and the deeds his President will ask of him for justice's sake.§!"

#General/Admiral bios

 GENERAL_WILLIAM_WESTMORELAND_DESC:0 "While a lot can be said about William Childs Westmoreland, both good and bad, few can doubt the position of power he currently holds over the United States Army. Graduating from West Point in 1936 and becoming a first lieutenant before the Fall of France, Westmoreland served with Valor under artillery battalions during the defense of the English mainland. Despite America having lost the war, Westmoreland returned home as a hardened veteran, providing valuable insight to combined arms theory and the improvement of the Armed Forces general staff. Completing airborne training in the aftermath, Westmoreland spent a large amount of his post-war years climbing the ranks of a career officer. Throughout the rest of the 50s, Westmore solidified himself as a key strategist and theorist for the new direction of America's ground forces. This would eventually promote him to Superintendent of the United States Military Academy, and later as one of America's most senior generals, charting the nation's course in terms of National Defense."
 GENERAL_EARLE_WHEELER_DESC:0 "Earle Gilmore "Bus" Wheeler, a DC Native, enlisted in the District of Columbia National Guard at the young age of 16 years old. After several promotions, he was eventually honorably discharged to enroll in the United States Military Academy, afterward serving in several military regiments as an officer. After a brief stint as a professor of mathematics, he would eventually get into training and leading several infantry divisions; including ones that served in the UK. Several successes and staunch leadership later landed him in the National War College before finally joining the United States General Staff in the late 50s. Since then, Wheeler has been one of the most important members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, working closely with the delicate, integrated command structure of the organization, and is currently ensuring that the Army is in tip-top shape. In Wheeler's eyes, perhaps again one day, he will fight (and win) against the fascist menace choking the heart of Europe and Asia."
 GENERAL_LYMAN_LEMNITZER_DESC:0 "Lyman Louis Lemnitzer's military career began with the now defunct United States Coastal Artillery Corps, enlisting as an artillery officer there after graduating from West Point in 1920. After serving for some years with his unit, Lemnitzer eventually left, returning to teach at West Point in 1926. With great ambition and the desire to do more for his country, Lemnitzer wound up in the United States Army Command and General Staff College as well as the United States Army War College; graduating from both with honors by 1940. Colonel Lemnitzer would eventually work his way up to serving with the War Plans Division of the Army, and would help assist the Army Ground Forces defending against Operation Sealion. Emboldened after America's loss in the war, Lemnitzer would eventually become a Deputy Commander back at the War College, of which his excellence at that position would land him in the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Stressing the importance of combined arms artillery in modern military doctrine, Lemnitzer is arguably the most senior member of the Joint Chiefs, and backs up his position with great wisdom alongside personal prowess."
 GENERAL_MAXWELL_TAYLOR_DESC:0 "Maxwell Davenport Taylor is best known among peers as daring and competitive with his military career; graduating 4th in his West Point class, serving as a Japanese diplomat and a Chinese attaché, being mentored by Matthew Ridgeway, graduating as a Major from the Army War College, and eventually coming into the position as the commander of the 101st Airborne Division. Under Taylor, "The Screaming Eagles" had great but limited successes in the UK. Once the war was lost, Taylor returned to West Point to serve as Superintendent, even writing the foundation for the modern Cadet Honor Code, but was later assigned to serve as Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Administration at the Pentagon. In this position, Taylor became critical of the Eisenhower administration's foreign policy shortcomings, later becoming an ally of President-Elect Nixon. Later appointed to the Joint Chiefs of Staff under the Nixon Administration, Taylor will use his experience as a skilled and veteran commander of the 101st to guide Special Operations on the ground force, wherever America may need them."
 GENERAL_CHARLES_BONESTEEL_DESC:0 "While Charles Hartwell "Tick" Bonesteel III was nothing but a simple Eagle Scout in his early days, he would eventually rise to prominence in his class at West Point during the early 30s; even becoming a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University. Bonesteel served in several senior administrative positions in the Pacific, doing his best to assist the war effort before the fateful Atomic Bombing of Pearl Harbor. After the war's end, Bonesteel became a special administrative assistant for the Secretary of State under President Eisenhower. Bonesteel's field experience and administrative positions have landed him among the most senior generals America has."
 ADMIRAL_DAVID_MCDONALD_DESC:0 "David Lamar McDonald almost never began his military career in the first place after learning he was too young to even enter into the prestigious United States Military Academy. Undaunted, McDonald chose instead to enter into the Riverside Military Academy in his native Georgia, later graduating and enlisting in the United States Naval Academy after a renewed interest in naval tactics. Upon graduation in 1928, McDonald served upon the Battleships Missouri and Colorado, later becoming a naval flight instructor. This experience allowed him to become a Flag Secretary in the Atlantic, and later as executive officer of the carrier USS Essex, serving in the Pacific against the Imperial Fleet. McDonald eventually worked further developing naval aviation doctrine after the war, serving on more aircraft carriers before becoming the Commander of the Sixth Fleet, and later becoming Chief of Naval Operations for the entire US Navy. The youngest four-star admiral in the entirety of the Navy, McDonald hopes to use his decades long experience controlling the seas under the banner of democracy once again for the good of the free world."
 ADMIRAL_THOMAS_MOORER_DESC:0 "Thomas Hinman Moorer can trace his family ancestry back to someone who fought for America's independence all the way back to the early days of the Revolution. As such, fighting against tyranny is in his blood. Although he grew up a rural Alabama boy, Moorer entered into the United States Naval Academy and graduated in 1933; becoming increasingly interested in naval aviation. Moorer would eventually complete naval aviation training, and would serve most of World War II flying with squadrons assigned to American Carriers in the Pacific theatre. After being shot down over the coast of Darwin, Moorer survived with a Purple Heart and tenacity which would further award him for helping to evacuate overrun islands in the Pacific at the height of Japanese air supremacy. At the war's conclusion, Moorer continued to serve in the Pacific Fleet before eventually becoming a Vice Admiral in 1962, hoping one day to get revenge on the Imperial Navy which had defeated the greatest fighting force he had ever known."
 ADMIRAL_HORACIO_RIVERO_DESC:0 "Horacio Rivero, although once a poor student from Puerto Rico, would become the first Hispanic admiral in United States history. After a recommendation to the United States Naval Academy which would change his life, he would graduate 3rd from his class and wind up in positions on heavy cruisers. Studying at MIT to master Electrical Engineering before reentering into the Navy, Rivero would serve on several battleships in the Pacific war, providing naval invasion support. Eventually, his command on the USS Pittsburgh would save all hands on deck during an enemy torpedo attack, gaining him widespread acclaim. After the conclusion of the Pacific war, Rivero continued his career working for several special agencies under the United States Navy. This would land him on the frontlines of the Hawaiian Missile Crisis, of which his unflinching tenacity perhaps kept the world from exploding. His leadership would allow him to be promoted to Admiral, breaking the glass ceiling and providing further excellence to wherever the Navy would be needed next under his command."

 POLITICS_RFK_DESC:0 "Robert Francis Kennedy certainly didn't grow up in an impoverished family. Part of the Kennedy dynasty of businessmen and politicians, his childhood was a privileged one. He grew up in suburban Massachusetts, one of nine children in a profoundly American family, and was raised to appreciate their Irish and Catholic heritage. Living through the Great Depression for most of his childhood, he witnessed his countrymen face impoverishment as they never had before.\n\nGoing on to attend Catholic schools across New England, Kennedy decided to serve in the Navy after the tragic death of his brother Joseph Kennedy in 1943. Kennedy would serve his country in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, with his relatively short service in the armed forces having a profound influence on his life, and his decision to enter politics.\n\nFollowing an honorable discharge, RFK entered journalism school, particularly interested in welfare and social programs designed to help the unfortunate. He was in attendance at the peace conference between the United States and Japan, and after the war visited Sweden to write about their extensive welfare programs. When his brother, John F. Kennedy, emerged as the running mate to Richard Nixon, Robert quickly proved his political acumen, to the extent that his brother would say that "If I need something done and done quick, I go to Bobby."\n\nTragedy would strike soon after. JFK's assassination not only broke Robert's heart - the death of his beloved brother severed any remaining ties to the R-Ds, whose President had vetoed the Civil Rights Act. Disillusioned with partisan politics, RFK decided to join the National Progressive Party, determined to make the American dream possible for all of his countrymen, and was promptly pushed to run for the Presidency. Swept into office in 1964, Robert became one of a rare breed. He became the champion of an American idealism seen in few others, someone who believed in hope in a world which possessed very little."
 POLITICS_LYNDON_B_JOHNSON_DESC:0 "In many ways Lyndon Baines Johnson, often referred to by his initials LBJ, is living proof that the American dream still lives. Born in a Texas farmhouse and raised in humble conditions, far from the glitz and glamour that America's elite grew up in, Johnson has not forgotten the lessons of his modest upbringing. Though he spent several years teaching impoverished children in Texas, he quickly found his calling in politics. With a natural talent for aggressive persuasion and dealmaking that would soon be widely known in Washington as the "Johnson Treatment", he began first as a congressional aide before quickly ascending to the House of Representatives, then the Senate. There he reigned as Majority Leader of the Republican and then Republican-Democrat party for a decade. Now he has finally climbed as high as any American can, and has been elected the President of the United States. LBJ has promised to heal the wounds that have been festering in America for decades, and is determined to tackle the issues of racial and economic inequality once and for all. Johnson envisions an American society where every man has equal rights and equal opportunity to succeed. However, with Germany descending further into chaos by the day, and Japan fighting to maintain and expand its sphere, Johnson may not be able to focus exclusively on the home front, as events beyond his control threaten to pull America back onto the global battlefield once more."
 POLITICS_RICHARD_NIXON_DESC:0 "Richard Milhous Nixon is a complicated figure. Originally a Representative, and then Senator from California, he rapidly rose through the ranks of Congress through skilled political manouvering. During his time as a Senator, Nixon worked closely with Joe McCarthy in carrying out the Grey Scare, working to root out suspected fascists in government. And while he didn't share the spotlight to the same extent as McCarthy did, nobody doubts that Nixon is still an anti-fascist crusader through and through.\n\nA lifelong member of the Republican Party, Nixon has never been totally comfortable working alongside the Democrats. The broad popularity of the National Progressive Party dictates that they must, however, and the coalition ticket that won him the 1960 election has made his presidency a living hell. John F. Kennedy's position as the Vice President has driven a wedge in the Executive Branch, as his own magnetic charisma and stunning competence have taken the spotlight away from Nixon more than once.\n\nAs much as Nixon wants to focus on foreign policy, so he can act to undermine the unstable German and Japanese empires, domestic affairs have gotten in the way. Civil rights issues can no longer be ignored, as racial tensions flare and people demand action, one way or another. While Nixon has been reluctant to endorse either segregation or integration, staying on the fence is becoming increasingly costly.\n\nOf course, Nixon is also doing what he can to keep the NPP down, including some... extralegal means. With challengers coming at him from all sides, including within the White House, Nixon will have a hell of a time trying to keep the ship of state steady."
 POLITICS_JFK_DESC:0 "John Fitzgerald Kennedy's path to political prominence was one overshadowed by others' controversies. Scion of the powerful Kennedy family and son of President Joseph Kennedy, John found himself recalled from the Pacific front after his elder brother Joseph Jr.'s death, and had been groomed to follow in his father's steps ever since. In the years following the 1948 election and the implosion of the Democratic Party, the Kennedys (with the exception of John's brother Robert) loyally followed the shattered remnants of the party to the GOP, becoming members of the Republican-Democrat Party. Some predicted that John's career would be tainted by the failures of Kennedy the Elder's administration, but John's personal charisma and political savvy were enough to help him grow out of his father's shadow. In 1960, he was on the Republican-Democrats' victorious Vice Presidential ticket. Unfortunately, his running mate was Richard Nixon.\n\nNow, John finds himself thrust into leadership of a nation in turmoil, one that desperately looks toward him for guidance. But for every American who sees him as a beacon of stability, there is one who sees him as an obstacle: ardent segregationists fear that his idealism will lead to him furthering civil rights legislation, and committed progressives scorn him for not being as impassioned as his brother Robert. Fate has ordained John F. Kennedy be the one to steer the ship of state, but will he be the one to guide it out of dangerous waters?"
 POLITICS_GEORGE_WALLACE_DESC:0 "George C. Wallace portrays himself a both an honorable Southern gentleman and a true red-blooded American, being the only one willing to protect his proud country from the Japanazi menace while preserving the rights and liberties his people hold dear. In reality he is an opportunist par excellence, willing to mold his ideology as he sees fit in order to maximize the possible turnout at the polls. Seeking to court the fine white voters as governor in his native Alabama, this inevitably manifested itself as a staunch segregationist platform, defending it on all fronts from un-American fifth columnists seeking to undermine states' rights. As the Democratic Party imploded in 1948 and the "Solid South's" party loyalty wavered, Wallace eagerly jumped ship to Richard Russell Jr.'s fledgling States' Rights Party, then to the Patriotic Party, then finally to the National Progressive Party.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Wallace successfully moderated his position just enough to win the support of the NPP's Frankensteinian voter base, and eventually the majority of the nation. Now that he finally sits in the White House, his alliance of convenience with many of the NPP's more left-leaning members is rapidly wearing thin - how do you hold together a party bound only by hatred of the establishment if you are the establishment? But Wallace likely doesn't plan for the alliance to last much longer. Rather, it seems he'll be using his time to legally buttress segregation as much as he can. When it is effectively impossible to dislodge, he will return home, where he shall be forever immortalized as the savior of the South."
 POLITICS_MARGARET_CHASE_SMITH_DESC:0 "Margaret Chase Smith has been making history her entire life. The first woman to serve in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The first woman to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee. The first woman to stand for the Presidency - and win. Every step of the way, her detractors have whispered that she would be a shrinking violet, unfit to serve - and President Smith delights in proving them wrong every time, having built a reputation as a hard-nosed and principled defense hawk over her two decades in Washington.\n\nTo her few allies, President Smith is a pillar of consistency in a fractious NPP; to her many rivals and enemies, President Smith is an infuriating iconoclast. She stunned her Republican Senate colleagues by being the first among them to break ranks and denounce Joseph McCarthy's Grey Scare as 'un-American' for its attack on civil liberties, even as Tokyo labeled her a 'beast in the shape of a woman' for commenting that she would have nuked Japan back after the atomic attack on Pearl Harbor. After abandoning the R-D's after their merger in 1951 (refusing, she said, to work with the architects of America's surrender) Smith has had an uneasy relationship with the rest of the NPP, utterly refusing to break bread with the NPP-Far Right's segregationists while chastising NPP-Center or former Republican colleagues if they seemed to be losing focus on the fascist threat.\n\nSmith is convinced that America must take the fight to - and defeat - the fascists, without selling its soul in the process. And now that the NPP has rallied behind her - if only to capitalize on the cowardice of the R-Ds while putting the segregationists to the side - President Smith faces the even more daunting task of convincing the rest of America that the fight against foreign tyranny is never done, while consigning the worst impulses of the NPP to the dustbin of history. It is her greatest challenge yet - but for President Smith, it's only Tuesday."

 POLITICS_JOHN_MCCORMACK_DESC:0 "For most presidents, their inauguration is the culmination of years of political ambition and success, bringing them to the highest office in the land and a chance to ultimately shape the nation to their ideals.\n\nFormer Speaker of the House John McCormack is not one such President. Rushed out of Congress and into the White House on a day of panic and blood, he is faced with a nation in turmoil. Outrage over President Nixon's actions on civil rights has shattered any semblance of political decorum in Congress, with constant shouting matches taking more time than legislation. The people have made their voice heard as well, with riots and protests breaking out weekly and voters changing their registration to support the radicals of the National Progressive Party.\n\nMcCormack has isolated himself in the White House, only speaking to trusted aides and friends on the matters affecting the nation and leaving his deputies to calm the turbulent waters America is headed for. Facing a party in crisis, the divisive issue of segregation, and the rapidly escalating war in South Africa, the reluctant president's next days in office will change the nation's direction for years to come."

 POLITICS_CURTIS_LEMAY_DESC:0 "If someone had told Curtis LeMay in 1962 that he'd be president in the next few years, he'd have laughed in their face and called them a damned fool. And yet, despite never seeking the office, LeMay finds himself in the Oval Office on the heels of George Wallace's disastrous presidency.\n\nNotorious for his comments on the 1964 campaign trail about "bombing Africa back to the Stone Age", the former Air Force general was considered a political liability by many members of Wallace's campaign for his gruff and apolitical nature. Never a true politician, LeMay's main role in the administration has been to address defense concerns, especially involving America's nuclear capabilities. Now, with the departure of Wallace, he must finally take a position on the issue of segregation. Surrounded by potential enemies and tasked with healing the troubled nation, clear skies for LeMay will be short in the coming days.\n\nStill, President LeMay has taken these events in remarkable stride. As the storm rages around him, he is confident that America will make it through this latest crisis. In 1943, he saw the greatest defeat in American history, riding out the storm at the controls of a heavy bomber, and now sees a chance for someone to finally take decisive action and heal the nation. Going forward, the President is absolutely certain of one thing: The United States will not fall into further turmoil on Curtis LeMay's watch. It wouldn't dare."

USA_SAF_WAR_IP_Sudwest_Desert_Training:0 "The Namibian deserts are harsh, hot, and hostile for our troops stationed in South Africa. We must prepare them for the landscape so that we can force the Sudwest out of the war early.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_IP_Zentral_Liberville_NI:0 "Libreville is a valuable city within the Afrikan realm, providing essential supplies to enemy troops. We need to focus our energy into an attack on this city; if we take Libreville, we damage the Zentral, and we take important resources away from the Reich's grasp.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_IP_Ost_AgtOrng:0 "The rough terrain of Ostafrika renders a land invasion nearly impossible. Luckily, we have the Rainbow Pesticides on our side. The use of these substances would clear out all the impassable foliage and make an invasion of Ostafrika much easier for our soldiers.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_IP_Rock_and_Roll_Mother_Fucker:0 "The jungles of Ostafrika provide a natural citadel for the stationed German troops. If we are to defeat the enemy, we must train our guys in jungle warfare. We need to be able to move swiftly through the trees and hit the Germans where they least expect it.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_SAF_Buying_Out_Guns:0 "Our allies in South Africa are always in need of more guns, rifles, whatever we have. Seeing as they are our allies in this war, it is imperative that we keep their soldiers supplied. We don't want a supply issue to hinder us from winning this war, so let's ship more weapons their way.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_Buying_Up_Everything:0 "Not only do the South Africans need guns, but they also need artillery and support equipment. Shipping over some of these materials would give our ally a strategic advantage. We need all the help we can get from South Africa if we want to win this war.\n"
USA_Send_One_Advisor:0 "We may not be as involved in this war as South Africa and her enemies, but we can always increase the number of advisors we send over. Though it may cause some backlash, our logistics and battle plans would be improved, and we could invest more resources to ensure a victory over the Germans.\n"
USA_Send_Two_Advisors:0 "This war is becoming increasingly important every day that we are over here. We need to expand our logistics capabilities even more, we need to bring more troops to join the fight no matter how much hate we get back home.\n"


### Domestic Tooltips

USA_SAF_WAR_Cranking_Up_Draft_tt:0 "The number of soldiers we are currently fielding is not nearly enough to win us the war. In order to bring more soldiers into the fold, we have to institute a draft. Many citizens back at home will certainly condemn us for this decision, but we must accept this consequence if we want to continue the fight."
USA_SAF_WAR_Cancelled_The_Draft_tt:0 "Our folks in the States are livid in their response to the draft. Protests are being held everywhere in our country, and we are starting to regret this decision. We must find a way to reverse the draft, no matter the cost, if we want to regain support for our government.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_No_More_Excuses_tt:0 "Ever since this war began, the practice of draft dodging has been widespread. In general, our young men are finding ways to avoid the draft. From this point forward, there will be no exceptions regarding who can be drafted. The more men we send over, the quicker this war will be over.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_reverse_the_exemptions_tt:0 "Our recently-drafted men are now resorting to even more drastic measures to ensure they can go back home. They are really bringing the morale of our whole army down; we must send them back, even if we have to lose some potential soldiers. Maybe the public will forgive this mishap.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_domestic_prop_tt:0 "Ever since the South African War began, people were holding anti-government protests. We need to activate the propaganda machine and cool the discontent that strangles our country. If we can convince the public that we can win this war, we will have one less domestic issue to worry about.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_take_out_troops_tt:0 "Our soldiers have been fighting for a while now, and we believe that giving a few battalions a trip home could work to our advantage. We may get some good publicity if we can bring some soldiers back home with smiles. This action would have a marginal effect on our remaining troops, but it would certainly give a little boost to war support.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_New_training_Shit_tt:0 "Our soldiers have been using up a lot of effort against the enemy. Not only does this produce a lack of ammo and supplies, but we also lose valued men when we put so much on the line. It's time to tone down the troops. We may lose some combat efficiency, but we will save human lives.\n"
USA_SAF_Talk_down_involvement_tt:0 "Support for this war is dwindling, and it's about time we put something in the papers. We have the option to reassure the public that we are not as involved in this war as the South Africans are. This will make our folks at home happy, but it could negatively impact South African troops and dampen their morale.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_bring_back_our_guns_tt:0 "This war is just not going in our favor, but we don't want to lose everything we have here. We must buy back the guns we loaned to our South African allies. This action would diminish whatever hopes our allies have left, but it would show the American public that we intend on ending the war soon."

Victory in Africa means nothing if we cannot stabilize the continent.\n\nSome of our officers have suggested continuing our strategy of attrition, using overwhelming firepower and superior tactics to eliminate as many rebels that we can while minimizing our own losses. However, diplomatic officials have suggested using a softer touch to win over the natives, which they claim will stabilize the continent better in the long term.

They waited with goosebumped flesh for the loud voices from Heaven to proclaim the world becoming that of the kingdom of God and his Messiah, and the salvation of their immortal souls.\n\nIt was then that the infernal things came from the sky, and the horns were joined by guitar and drum and a voice like wailing, and the farmers cowered at what they now recognised as their destruction. The sky lit up like the pits of the abyss, and fire rained down upon them, and smoke filled the air, and ghastly filth poured over the land to wither all it touched.\n\nThrough it all the farmers shrieked and cried as their lives were ripped from their bodies. Some sought to comfort loved ones, others begged for the Lord's mercy. Young men ran in futility as their elders kneeled and awaited the brutal heat and sudden cold of death.\n\nIn but a few short minutes life was wiped from the bushveld, and not a one of them remained to see the American commander lean out of his helicopter to taste the air. He breathed deeply of the smoke and ash of his creation, and he knew it was good as he gazed upon the blasted landscape, devastation undreamt of by any ancient warmaster or khan. The commander looked to the vastness above and said a silent prayer to the same God the Boers begged to save them as they burned. He made a signal and the helicopters left back through the smoke, blasting their music as they left the cratered annihilation and its piles of black ash behind them, ash that had once been men who had hoped and dreamed and loved.\n\nLater, they would learn intel had been mistaken, and the village was not the rebel enclave they had thought it to be, but by then they had moved on to burn other villages in other lands, and it mattered little to them and was soon forgotten." #duplicate loc key

USA_debate.1.t:0 "Debate with Michael Harrington!"
USA_debate.1.desc:0 "Under the glare of the television cameras, President Wallace F. Bennett and Michael Harrington walk stiffly towards each other, offering each other thin smiles and a wooden handshake. The two are hardly friendly; Harrington has been a vocal critic of Bennett's international policy since day one of the administration, singling out Bennett's preferential trade policies with the OFN as a betrayal of American labor.\n\nAs the debate moves into the topic of foreign affairs, Harrington wastes no time going on the attack. "Mr. President, I'm often approached by people on the street - good, hardworking, honest Americans - asking whether they'll have a job next year. These are miners, steelworkers, farmers - the beating heart of American industry. How can you claim to be keeping America strong, when your administration subsidizes the purchase of foreign goods, leaving Americans grasping for pennies?"\n\nBennett smiles neutrally back at Harrington. "The beautiful thing about trade, Mr. Harrington, is that everyone benefits. You say that American industry is being weakened; I say that it's roaring to ever-greater heights, as tariffs come down across the OFN. You say that America is weakened by our purchases from our allies; would you prefer that we squeeze our allies dry, like the Nazis and their puppets? America can never stand alone in this world, and certainly not while facing the likes of the Germans and the Japanese."

USA_debate.2.desc:0 "President Wallace F. Bennett and Senator Margaret Chase Smith walked briskly towards each other, shaking hands briefly before turning to their podiums. In earlier times, the two had been cordial acquaintances in the Senate, united by love of country despite sitting on opposite sides of the aisle. But there would be no quarter today, with the Presidency up for grabs.\n\nSmith wasted no time shifting on the attack. "President Bennett, you speak of brotherhood between the peoples of the free world through freer trade within the OFN. Though the OFN must remain united against oppression, I question the wisdom of your approach; your policy confuses leadership with foolhardiness, charging ahead while turning a deaf ear to American workers and industry. The Treaty Ports should remind us all of the costs of ignoring American interests for naive hopes - of appeasement thirty years ago, or of fraternal brotherhood today."\n\n"Senator Smith, we distinguish ourselves from Japan and Germany by our promise that America stands for a free, prosperous world. The OFN is a community of peoples: it is not a vehicle for totalitarian domination, or colonial dependency. Free trade is the surest means by which freedom survives, binding peoples together in free and open exchange." President Bennett stared Smith down. "We must prosper together, or we shall perish alone."

USA_debate.3.t:0 "Debate with Michael Harrington!"
USA_debate.3.desc:0 "President Johnson and Michael Harrington eyed each warily, looking for an angle of attack. There was surprisingly little traction to be had on issues of policy: pundits had noted that Johnson's Great Society and Harrington's answers for the Other America had a great deal in common. The debate would be decided on the question of trust, of suitability for the nation's highest office.\n\nPresident Johnson cleared his throat. "Mr. Harrington, while I must respect your compassion, I have my questions about the company you keep. The American people wonder how the NPP will govern in practice, instead of in theory, especially when you've got the likes of Gus Hall shouting about nationalization and class warfare. There is plenty to work on in America, but shouting Bukharinist nonsense isn't how you go about it."\n\nHarrington's face twisted in indignation. "Is that how low you'll go? Judging an entire party of your fellow Americans by the most radical among us? I will be unequivocally clear: Mr. Hall's views are at the extreme fringe of the party, I do not endorse them, and the party's leadership does not endorse them. We stand for an inclusive America, a caring America, an America where a man doesn't need to fear the boot of the blackshirt or the commissar, but instead trust in the charity of their fellow man. It is beneath you, Mr. President, to fall back on fear instead of civil virtue."

USA_debate.4.desc:0 "President Lyndon B. Johnson and Senator Margaret Chase Smith, once colleagues in the Republican party in the brief years before the formation of the R-Ds, wore stony smiles as they approached each other on the stage. The fallout of Smith's abandonment of the Republicans still rankled: for Johnson, Smith was a constant annoyance, while Smith resented Johnson for putting power over principles.\n\nSmith wasted no time going on the attack. "President Johnson, you speak highly of your Great Society, about alleviating poverty and want. But my constituents see an economy stuck in neutral, while the demands of the taxman grow year after year. You may have good intentions, President Johnson, but redistribution without prosperity is simply stagnation."\n\n"Senator Smith, you and I both know the result when business is allowed to pursue profits over people." President Johnson replied acidly. "I don't think anyone's eager to go back to a time when soup kitchens were the only relief for millions of Americans."

USA_debate.5.desc:0 "Senator Barry Goldwater and President Robert F. Kennedy hardly smiled as they approached each other, exchanging a wooden handshake before turning promptly towards their respective podiums. The compassionate gentleman of the C-NPP and the doctrinaire conservative of the R-D's had hardly seen eye-to-eye during their years in Washington, and they weren't about to start now.\n\n"President Kennedy, it is my patriotic duty to remind you that the Treasury is not a bottomless well for your bleeding heart!" Goldwater criticized harshly. "The American people have a right to know, and to question, the use of their hard-earned money and the growth of the national debt, and they are saying: 'An American is entitled to the sweat of his brow!'"\n\nKennedy threw Goldwater a disdainful glare. "Senator Goldwater, try walking up to the unemployed veteran, or the mother struggling with the burden of caring for their four children, and tell them that all they're entitled to is the sweat of their own brow. As if they deserve their poverty. These people don't need slogans; they need our help!"

Too perfect; the two seasoned politicians were too practiced to do something so crass as to let their disdain for each other show in public.\n\n"President Wallace has let far too many of America's sons die in foreign lands in pursuit of - what, exactly?" Goldwater questioned. "Fascists must be resisted, but your support for maximum force in South Africa, the carpet bombings and bombardments that raze whole cities to weed out a battalion! It borders on the bloodthirsty, throwing American lives away for political gain."\n\n"Senator Goldwater, am I the only here who remembers your... enthusiasm for tactical nuclear weapons? That with one bomb, you could do the work of an entire division and save their lives to boot?" Wallace bristled. "War is hell, and we can't pretend it isn't. You say that war can be made easy with a single bomb; I assume you, Senator, that you would put America on the road to Armageddon in the name of victory."

The unlikely astronaut leader of the R-D's and the patrician-turned-prodigal son of the NPP faced each other on the stage, sharpening their verbal knives to draw blood from the slight differences in their dreams of a brighter future.\n\n"Governor Glenn, your reputation as America's first astronaut precedes you in politics." Kennedy smiled, but without a hint of warmth in his eyes. "But the American people today look for solutions for their problems here on Earth: poverty, discrimination, education. We seek a more perfect union here at home, rather than escape it in the stars."\n\nGlenn bristled at Kennedy's comments. "I assure you, President Kennedy, that our platform is far more than just a return to space. But if you insist on questioning the value of America's space program, I can point to every schoolchild who came up to me in the years following Gemini, asking if they too can bring America to the stars. To ask themselves, to dream, of the promise of America and its potential. And dreams motivate us far more than despair.""

Wallace's segregationism had viscerally angered nearly everybody in the North, a sentiment shared by Glenn. Wallace, for his part, barely hid a sneer at the latest Northern carpetbagger looking to tread on his beloved South.\n\nThe debate, predictably, centered on the question of civil rights, and Glenn did not hold back. "President Wallace, I can't understand why you insist on segregation in the 20th Century. By what right do you seek to deny good, honest Americans their rights?"\n\n"Governor, I'm not surprised by your utopian dreams, having gone to space and back," Wallace replied acidly. "Come back to Earth, Governor: we are a union of states, and my constituents demand that their rights be respected."\n\n"Whose rights? President Wallace, I'll make this simple: do you stand by what you said three years ago?" Glenn snapped.\n\nA second passed, an eternity onstage. Wallace's eyes widened for a brief instant, then narrowed, hardened. "Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever? Yes, I do."

USA_debate.9_thurmond:0 "A nation, traumatized in the wake of Robert F. Kennedy's assassination and the chaos of President Thurmond, prayed for the triumph of reason and calm as Governor John Glenn and Michael Harrington took to the stage. To their great comfort, the two politicians were more than content to let their oratory take center stage - but words could cut as deep as any sword.\n\n"Mr. Harrington, we're both men who look at America as it ought to be, trusting that this country is - and must - march towards a brighter future." Glenn said. "I admire that, but can you say that your party shares your vision? With respect to the late Robert Kennedy, Americans have seen the NPP spend the past few months arguing endlessly with itself over his legacy, with the policies of the Thurmond administration buffeting your party like a toy boat in a storm. How can you convince the American people that your party shares your vision?"\n\n"The American people will judge my leadership of the National Progressive Party." Harrington responded. "The deprivation faced by millions of Americans, who are penniless and homeless in the wealthiest country on Earth, is a travesty that must be addressed. The National Progressive Party has come behind me, to grapple with and put to rest the worsening problems Americans face in their everyday lives. We are called to minister to people on Earth, Governor, not abandon them for the stars.""
USA_debate.9_lemay:0 "Governor John Glenn and Michael Harrington walked onstage to overenthusiastic applause, wearing forced smiles and shaking hands vigorously before the rapturous acclaim of a nation grasping for normality. It was a pantomime of politics as it should be, as it had been, before the impeachments of Richard Nixon and George Wallace had disgraced America twice in under a decade.\n\n"Mr. Harrington, we're both men who look at America as it ought to be, trusting that this country is - and must - march towards a brighter future." Glenn said. "I admire that, but does your party share your vision? Over the past few months, the American people bore witness to the very real fractures in your party, at war with itself over the impeachment of George Wallace. How can you claim that the NPP can lead American into the next decade, after four years of bitter division?"\n\n"The American people will judge my leadership of the National Progressive Party." Harrington responded. "I stand for those Americans who suffer, through no fault of their own, from racial discrimination, from poverty, and from hunger. The National Progressive Party has come behind me, to address the worsening problems Americans face in their everyday lives. We are called to minister to people on Earth, Governor, not abandon them for the stars.""

To their great comfort, the leading lights of conservatism and socialism in America were more comfortable settling their differences with oratory, rather than violence - but words could cut as deep as any sword.\n\n"Mr. Harrington, I will admit that I admire your humanity, your passion for the downtrodden and the disadvantaged." Goldwater stated emphatically. "But no man is an island, especially in politics. And I cannot help but wonder: how many stand with you in your own party? These past months have laid bare the agonizing disagreements within your party over the legacy of Bobby Kennedy. How can one lead when one's own house is in disarray?"\n\n"Senator, the American people will judge my leadership of the National Progressive Party." Harrington deftly countered. "Let me ask you a question, Senator Goldwater: how many must suffer for lack of food or shelter in your America of fiscal austerity and propriety? The deprivation faced by millions of Americans, who are penniless and homeless in the wealthiest country on Earth, can no longer be ignored.""

The bloodletting in the streets, the cries of the Little Rock school children before their death! America remembers, Mr. Harrington: how can you bring the nation together in the wake of all this?"\n\nHarrington glared daggers at Goldwater. "Senator, my long standing support for Civil Rights legislation is a matter of public record. Under my leadership, the National Progressive Party will not tolerate racism and discrimination, whether by skin color or the quality of their work. A far cry from your policies, Senator Goldwater: in your America of fiscal 'propriety' and 'austerity', how many more Americans must suffer for lack of food or shelter, and be told that they deserve their lot in life?""

Smith smiled cryptically. "But we must stand for more than our past achievements, for which the National Progressive Party has united behind the principles of fairness before the law, succor for those in need, and defending our republican way of life against our enemies.

Johnson and Michael Harrington, who otherwise shared much in common on their prescription for the ills of American society, cut a sharp contrast from the moment they stepped on stage. A smiling Johnson towered over Michael Harrington as he vigorously manhandled Harrington's arm before the cameras. Harrington, to his credit, refused to budge or flinch, a quiet force radiating against Johnson's energetic presence.\n\nTheir roles reversed as the debate kicked off, with Harrington launching into a surprising criticism of Johnson's administration. "President Johnson, your Great Society suffers from a lack of ambition. The root causes of grinding poverty, of unemployment, of the debasement of human dignity remain unaddressed. We both agree on the role of government in fundamentally bettering American lives, yet you focus on treating symptoms while ignoring the cure that millions hope to receive."\n\n"Well, Mr. Harrington, you certainly don't lack for conviction." President Johnson replied. "But when you speak of dreams, I deliver results. Ask any American on the street: are they safer, healthier, more satisfied with their life? We both agree that politics is about people; but results matter as much, if not more than, ideas in politics. And I can promise you, if you believe that the Great Society isn't ambitious enough, you ain't seen nothing yet."

But the devil was in the details, and Bennett was nothing if not a master of the details.\n\nBennett made a show of holding up Harrington's domestic policy platform - a veritable tome. "I admire your passion, Mr. Harrington. The crusade for the common man." He smiled. "But have you actually considered what it means to implement this? These programs, promising to bring the federal government into every facet of American life - you'd be talking about doubling, tripling the federal budget. Can you convince Americans why the federal government must bear all the burdens carried by our states and our communities?"\n\nHarrington wasn't lacking for a response. "Mr. President, it's easy to say that things can't be done. But the reality is, beyond the walls of this auditorium, I have seen another America, one that suffers for want of food, dignity, and security. And this is before we factor in the struggles faced by our African-American communities! How can we claim to be the mightiest, the wealthiest nation on Earth, if we cannot feed our poor and shelter our homeless? The question is not whether we can or cannot; it isn't even a question.

The focus of the debate would be domestic policy - and both would be well versed in the details. The argument would not, could not, be won on its merits, but Bennett and Smith were nothing if not resourceful, and more than willing to take a few cheap shots.\n\n"President Bennett, you promised the American people stability after the tumult of Richard Nixon's impeachment." Smith smiled, before plunging her dagger home. "But a President is elected to lead, not to manage. The American people dream of moving confidently into the new decade, of reuniting with the Treaty Ports, not of smoke-filled rooms and committee minutiae. Nothing great was ever achieved by an abundance of caution."\n\nPresident Bennett's neutral expression hid his biting response. "Senator, if I have observed anything in my years in government, it is that the National Progressive Party has many dreams and many faces, to the point I have trouble hearing who speaks for the party as a whole. You accuse me of boring consistency in my commitment to maintaining the fabric of our Republic; I say that the American people prefer evolution to revolution, especially if the revolutionaries can hardly agree on what to have for breakfast, let alone their vision for the nation."

USA_debate.13.desc:0 "While urban machines exchanged deals for votes and committees arranged donation drives and canvasses as they always had, America's voting public spectated the quadrennial tradition's most recent addition in the comfort of homes the nation over. At the Walnut Street Theater in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Republican-Democrat candidate Robert McNamara engaged his National Progressive counterpart Margaret Chase Smith in the first of a series of televised presidential debates covering topics both foreign and domestic. Below is an excerpt of their heated exchange that night:\n\nMcNamara: "There will soon come a time when we are obliged to fulfill our duties as the Free World's custodian once again. Deluding ourselves from acknowledging the likelihood, or the necessity, of future interventions is counterproductive folly; in that regard, I am thankful that President Smith and I are in full agreement. But I believe we also have a duty to learn from prior interventions and the mistakes we've committed in them, that we can finish said duties expediently. Here, I fear, is where the Madam President is negligent."\n\nSmith: "I won't be so easily fooled by your sales pitch, Mr. Secretary. Despite the backhanded insult you've levied on our armed forces, the fact of the matter's that we have indeed learned from mistakes like South Africa. Our forces' stellar performance in Indonesia and the Middle East has validated Mr. Rumsfeld and his reforms to the American people. Hence we can now boast a military capable of responding to attacks against the Free World at any time - and, if I might add, save Arlington thousands of crosses while doing so.""

Below is an excerpt of their heated exchange that night:\n\nSmith: "My administration emphasized confronting fascism abroad. In this regard, we were successful. Japan was contained within the Pacific, Germany contained within Europe. The tethers that bind the peoples they subjugate fray with every year we held the line, leaving them free to slip away as they had in Africa and Southeast Asia. Containment has been a stellar success; why should we do away with something that clearly works?"\n\nMcGovern: "And look how your four years turned out for the world, Madam President. Our enemies still field war machines by the ten thousands. Our allies still yearn for support we can give them but somehow won't. We're no more farther from nuclear war today than we were in 1968; in fact, we may even have moved closer towards it, Hawaii notwithstanding. Shouldn't we at least seek another path that delivers lasting success, rather than content ourselves with eternally seesawing between fragile peace and Armageddon?""

At the Walnut Street Theater in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, National Progressive candidate Michael Harrington engaged his Republican-Democrat counterpart Robert McNamara in the first of a series of televised presidential debates covering topics both foreign and domestic.\n\nThe armed forces dominated tonight's heated parlay, with President Harrington launching a slew of rebukes against the former Secretary of Defense for proposing a sizable increase of what he believed was their already excessive budget. "Imagine where we could have been today," he impressed, "if the billions we had spent on guns and bombs went instead to the millions living in our alleyways and ghettos without a cent to their name, and not end solely in the bank accounts of executives wealthier than entire states!"\n\nMcNamara retorted by reiterating America's pledge to protect the Free World from fascist encroachments - a responsibility, he argued, properly honored only with a capable military. "President Harrington has a responsibility to learn the lessons from South Africa and Indonesia and apply them for the Free World's betterment," the Secretary elaborated. "That its sworn protector disregards actions taken in its defense altogether is a grave indictment of his record as our commander-in-chief, rather than an achievement worth celebrating.""

You decry the foreign entanglements it invites without considering its other purpose - that is, to nurture the world's free nations until they can stand on their own two feet. We musn't dawdle over unseen Americas while the Free World languishes in plain sight; a balance has to be struck somehow, and I know a balance exists. If only you had endeavored to seek it."\n\nHarrington: "Are you perhaps a man of Scripture, Senator? 'The way of sinners is made plain with stones, but at the end thereof is the pit of hell.' I speak for an America that has lost its appetite for senseless adventures abroad; tying ourselves further with those who ask of it is no better than laying the stones that has lead to the bloodlettings we've witnessed in South Africa, Indonesia and Arabia. I assure you that America will someday cast its full gaze towards oppressed peoples beyond its borders - but not now, not while so many of our own clamor for freedom still.""

Below is an excerpt of their heated exchange that night:\n\nKirkpatrick: "$$25 billion, Mr. President. That's the most optimistic estimate of how much your pet rockets have swindled since 1968. It's a misuse of public trust so blatant you might as well have worn it like an overcoat! Thinking of what could have been funded with that much money angers me and the American taxpayer - I certainly would have spent it on confronting threats more pressing to the Free World than aliens on Mars."\n\nGlenn: "You'd have a stronger point if my administration had spent $$25 billion on space exploration and nowhere else, Mrs. Kirkpatrick. The nuclear plants and welfare programs we've set up say otherwise. I can at least sign my budgets with a clean conscience if nothing else, and with thoughts of a destiny greater than myself; yours, as I understand, has barely any room for either.""

Now, years after the simmering defeat of the last great war, the government finds itself facing these enemies once more, not within the wintry dread of political machinations and espionage; rather, it is time for the United States to prepare once more for the battlefield. Now is the time for the United States to rise, and lead the march for freedom, for liberty, for democracy!\n\nThanks to the preparations of our administrations and Presidents prior, the United States has come leagues ahead of preparedness compared to our worries of the past. However, we have a long path ahead of us if we intend to defeat the enemies of America. Nevertheless, we shan't suffer again, we shall defeat these bastards, once and for all!"
USA_ww3_mobilize_the_army_desc:0 "The United States, despite the sufferings of wars lost in history's turned pages, has grown to possess one of the most effective, most respected, and most powerful armies on the world's stage. Thousands of American men and women have proven themselves as heroes of the American people in the Army.\n\nHowever, although the power within the Army remains unquestioned, we must face the realities of some issues. The Army is a ferocious beast, but a beast that must be roused to action from slumber. However, the war-cries of Americans' enemies have rung out across the world; thus, it is time to spurn our own beast to action, and let loose the true hounds of war: the United States Army. The Army must begin immediate effective mobilization in order to respond to the growing encroachment of enemy forces, while bringing the reserves to the front lines. The United States Army must be prepared to take the offensive and be ready to strike!"
USA_ww3_scramble_the_airforce_desc:0 "The skies, holding the sun, the moon, and the stars, have become the newest addition to the ways in which humanity can wage warfare. From the skies above the Marne to the storms raging above Saint-Mihiel, the United States set a precedent for the quality sought in men seeking to bring the fury of the United States Armed Forces to the heavens above.\n\nHowever, the strength of our enemies have grown to match such fury, and bring about fiery destruction with their advancements in technology and tactics, with the potential of our enemies to spread death and terror if they penetrate our air defenses. Furthermore, the administration has come to realize that the Air Force being spread out across the country has handicapped its ability to move effectively to the new warzones being created everyday. We must set the Air Force to the highest alert, and have our aerial units ready to face the enemy within a moment's notice!"
USA_ww3_emergency_naval_procurement_act_desc:0 "The Pentagon's forecast attrition rates beggar belief. Soldiers, equipment, ships, and aircraft will be written off at an astronomical rate, expended to keep the war far from the American homeland.

If the Pentagon's estimates are accurate, the shipyards will need to be spun up to full capacity now to make sure the Navy keeps the war away from home."
USA_ww3_naval_invasion_crash_course_desc:0 "Although the protection of a navy shows in the guarding the open waters surrounding the United States on all sides, it can be safely assumed that the United States Navy can only act as a shield around our lands for so long. The Fascists have struck quickly and viciously before, and we cannot hope that staying on the defense will save us. No, we shall penetrate the barriers of the seas to strike against our enemies shores, to plunge the sword of the American military deep into the hearts of our enemies before we dare allow them to take the first step.\n\nUnfortunately, although the plans shall be ambitious, we must prepare for such aspirations lest we intend to see our military plunge to the bottom of the seas. Thus, the administration shall immediately order the instruction of naval invasion preparation and execution to our military command. Our command will take the first step, strike first, and cut the throat of the beast before it dares to claim the lives of any more good-hearted Americans!"
USA_ww3_impliment_war_bonds_desc:0 "America's participation in the first two World Wars stretched the financial resources of the country to the limit, and the realities of modern, mechanized warfare have come at a higher cost than we could have ever imagined. Income taxation will not nearly be enough to fill the yawning chasm of the discretionary budget, and our financial institutions and capital markets are beginning to balk at the successive regular bond issuances by the Treasury. We need to take our financing drive directly to the American people, mobilizing their savings for the war effort through retail war bonds."

In those years past, the people of the United States acted as the blood within the Great Dragon that awoke, allowing the production necessary to modernize the war effort in the skies above.\n\nNow, however, we, as Americans, have found ourselves facing the damning strength of our enemies. Now, what we need is not only the talent and experience of the military, but the equipment necessary to secure our superiority, especially within the skies. Thus, the administration will work towards nationalizing several airline manufacturers to bring them to support the war effort within the United States. Sure, our critics may cite this as 'feeding the Military-Industrial Complex,' but we are at war, damnit!"

And as Private Rodney Bannister was about to find out, as he sat resting in his bunk with dreams of his family and girlfriend swimming through his mind, it would be the most comfortable place he'd have the grace to pass through for a long, long time.\n\n"Get your fucking asses up, now, all of you!" Gunnery Sergeant Hewitt commanded, exploding into the dark and formerly silent resting quarters of the young soldiers. Bannister hurried to attention, as had his fellow Soldiers all around him as they all faced forwards where the Gunnery Sergeant came forward. "Get your shit together, men, the United States is at war! Get your utilities on and your asses in gear, be formed up outside the barracks at 0430, move it!" the Gunnery Sergeant exploded before leaving the room. The glass of stability which had continuously wavered in strength for Bannister was shattered as the Gunnery Sergeant left the room. Sure, he'd trained and all for the prospect of serving his country, but he never expected the day would come when everything went to hell like this. Bannister threw his uniform together as best he could and hurried out, along with the rest of his platoon.\n\nOutside, the frigid air of an early Kentucky morning was evident, but the rush of fear and terror was what truly crawled up the soldiers that morning. Standing at attention, Bannister stared forward as he saw his Gunnery Sergeant come into frame, yelling to his platoon, "The United States of America has, as all of you know, entered a state of war with the same men responsible for our defeat in the 1940's. Some of your fathers know that all too well, some of them may have even fought alongside myself back in England. All of that has come back, and we will not allow those bastards to harass the world any longer. Your platoon is being transferred to Fort Carson in Colorado, where you will all undergo extensive training to prepare for deployment out to fight those who think they can fuck with the goddamned United States. Hooah, soldiers." the Gunnery Sergeant concluded.\n\nAs Private Bannister continued forward with the rest of his platoon to get onto the trucks heading to Fort Carson. But no matter what, he couldn't shake the fear out of his head. This was it, what if he never got to see Jennifer again? Or, what about the rest of his family, and his little brother?

She'd always been that way whenever Isaac decided to go to one of the school dances. Rather, he found himself in a somber atmosphere as his mom drove him down the Pennsylvanian road to the Army office in Harrisburg. Finally, the car came to a halt right in front of the big brick building. He felt his mother's tears grace his cheek as they hugged one last time before he walked towards the building.\n\nThe inside was an absolute disaster. Hundreds, if not nearly a thousand boys like him had received the same yellow slip titled "Order to Report for Induction" notifying him of his draft into the military. He waited his turn in line for hours until finally, he exchanged his paperwork with the woman behind the desk, approving him for his conscripted entrance into the United States Army after a quick physical and mental health check and approval test with the words "infantrymen" written on top. A few days later, he looked out the window of the moving truck, thinking of how he was going to be toting a rifle on some battlefield, surrounded by blood and filth, instead of studying economics at Stanford like the plan was. However, the journey didn't end there, as he sat while his hair was nearly shaved off by the Army barbers at Fort Carson. Finally, a Staff Sergeant came over to the new recruits, yelling, "Welcome to the United States Army, gentlemen. The United States has gone to war and we need your talent to serve the armed forces now more than ever." His voice droned on, but Isaac picked up as he heard the Staff Sergeant continue, "...Summers, Drake, Clarence, you eight are gonna be led by Corporal Bannister." as the soldier moved forward to the rightmost of the squad. Now, out in the middle of Colorado, was where the army's finest will find their way to the front lines.\n\nThe mud continued to gunk up Isaac's teeth as the barbed wire scraped against his ankles, as the recruit crawled and gunshots popped above him at the firing ranges nearby. All of a sudden, a hand popped in front of him beneath the barbed wire, and Corporal Bannister's face came out of the blur. "Come on, man, I've got you." The corporal said, as he helped pull Isaac forward. Isaac felt a genuine care and concern within the Corporal's voice as he got through it, feeling a connection to his squad leader."

The Private's thoughts had almost drowned out the stomping of boots behind him as his squad leader, Corporal Bannister approached, rousing Summers to attention.\n\n"You're fine, Summers, take the time to enjoy yourself." Bannister said to the young Private, who looked troubled. "Thinking ahead?" the Corporal asked, thinking about the weeks they had spent travelling aboard the John Pope.. "Honestly, sir, no. Thinking about the past, more like, thinking of everything before all of this, before, well, the draft went out, uh, sir." He said while looking out into the waves crashing on the side of the boat. "Yeah, I get that, Summers. I didn't get that whole draft thing, I was down at the most comfortable base in Kentucky, thinking about how serving the country could help out paying for the wedding with my Jennifer. Think she's gonna be pissed with how long I'll be gone." The Corporal said, chuckling. Noticing his squadling's less than enthusiastic response, he asked, "Well, what about you, Summers? Where are you from?" The Private took a minute to respond, thinking of everything leading up to now. "Came out of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, just graduated out of high school, finalizing my application to Stanford to study economics, was thinking of going federal with the job. Managed to get top of my class too, things were looking great. Sure, no girlfriend, like you, sir, and only a mom back at home, but it looks like the world had other plans."\n\nThe Corporal heard the Private's downtrodden voice, and offered a pat on the back. "Hey, I wasn't a Stanford kid, and economics aren't my forte, but what's to say we have to be sad about it. Things are rough, but the country needs us, good people like your mother needs us, now more than ever. If you wanted to help change the world, you've found your way there, Summers, because America needs people like you who can grit their teeth and keep going.

Maurine Neuberger, Scoop's deputy and fellow senator in the NPP's Center wing, quietly thumbed through her notes as she waited for him to speak. Next to her sat the nominal head of the Center's more radical wing, Michael Harrington, who waited with the same expectant look as Scoop himself. The two could not be more different, but as the Center's leader, Scoop knew he needed both if the party was going to get anywhere.\n\n"As you know, our election prospects are still looking dire," began Scoop. "The Right still holds plenty of influence over the party, and no progressive voter is going to vote for the party whose last candidate was Strom goddamn Thurmond. Worst of all, we still don't even have a candidate!"\n\n"Well it would help if anyone had bothered to put their name forward," joked Harrington, with a bare hint of contempt. "Perhaps if we were to do more to support our core working class voters in the Midwest and elsewhere rather than kowtowing to segregationists... and filling our ranks with West Coast elitist types-"\n\nNeuberger, herself of proud Oregon stock, sat up with an offended look. "Everyone here is fighting for the same thing! I've done plenty to speak up for the underprivileged - at least I don't just sit around writing essays about it!"\n\nScoop sat still for a moment, smiling bemusedly as his colleagues continued to bicker and snipe at one another. In a way, they were a perfect reflection of the Center as a whole - determined to enact change, but endlessly at its own throat about what that change should be. Finally, he coughed, and the other two immediately ceased their childish exchange and looked to him once more. "You are both very different, which is exactly why we need somebody who can speak everyone's language. If we're to have any hope in this election, we need to move forwards with one voice."\n\nHarrington and Neuberger looked at each other unsure of what to say.

"How are you, Bobby? Ethel still taking good care of you I hope?"\n\nRobert Francis Kennedy laughed at the playful wink his brother gave him. "I can hardly complain on the home life, Jack." His grin faded. "Still, current events haven't exactly been great for my sleep."\n\nThe older Kennedy nodded sympathetically. "The violence is getting worse, for sure." He frowned. "Nixon being a stick in the mud about it isn't helping things either. He still won't endorse any legislation on the matter."\n\n"Can't you do something about it? As long as the President sits on the fence, things will only get worse."\n\n"I'd love to, but you know how Nixon is," muttered John, idly stirring his coffee. "Knowing him he'd probably just veto whatever we put in front of him and yell at us for 'fracturing party unity'.\n\n"But this is far more important than party unity Jack! There are millions of Americans - millions of good, honest people - being cast aside for things that are far beyond their control. The longer we wait, the greater their suffering will be." Fixing his brother with an intense but encouraging look, he continued. "You're the Vice President.

Like I'd leave you for the NPP or anyone else, especially when you're about to give this country the change it so desperately deserves!"\n\nRobert's enthusiasm, seemingly infectious, prompted more laughs from his brother. "Now, now, we have a lot of work to get through before we can set things in motion." His look became more serious, more determined. "The party's image is somewhat tarnished at the moment with the Nixon fiasco, so I've arranged some trips across the country to shore up support." At this, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a long itinerary of events and dates in various states and cities and handed it to Robert.\n\n"Of course. We do have the election to worry about." Robert frowned, before reverting to a smile. "Come on Jack, I suppose we can just enjoy this meal before your big tour, you've earned it."\n\nAnd so the brothers sat for a while longer, enjoying their food in peace.

Still, he had to try.\n\nFinally, the door to the office swung open. In walked Scoop Jackson, closely followed by his underlings Neuberger and Harrington. The three regarded Kennedy curiously yet hopefully as they sat opposite him, each shaking his hand in turn. Scoop was the first to speak. "This is certainly unusual. But I hear good things about you, Mr Kennedy. We have a few questions for you before we go any further."\n\nOver the next twenty minutes, the impromptu Center committee picked Robert's brains over a wide variety of issues. "How committed are you to the Civil Rights Act?" asked Scoop. "You agree that the state of healthcare in this country is disgraceful?" asked Harrington. "Don't you think this country should do more to protect the environment?" asked Neuberger. It felt almost like a college debate club, but Robert answered all their questions thoroughly and enthusiastically.\n\nAs their questioning came to a close, Robert spoke up. "The Republican-Democrats no longer represent this country, nor are they willing to do what is necessary for its people. I want to join you because I feel that you represent the change that I believe in... and the change that my brother believed in."\n\nScoop glanced sideways to his associates. Neuberger nodded with a smile. Harrington paused, then gave a small nod in assent.

A peace where everyone could work towards the advancement of science, prosperity and-\n\nA sudden ringing cut across his psyche, and he was jolted from a dream of days past. Sitting sluggishly awake from his sadly earthbound bed, he fumbled for the telephone on his bedside cabinet and pulled the receiver to his ear. "John Glenn, speaking - way too early in the morning might I add."\n\nA panicked voice came across the line. "John, it's James. Have you heard the news?"\n\nGlenn rubbed the sleep out of his eyes and replied "James Edwin Webb, I have not even got out of bed yet. Be more specific-"\n\n"They're defunding NASA!"\n\nA hastily-made coffee and frantic flip through the morning paper later, and John Glenn felt a wrench in his gut as he faced the prospect of his life's work being all for naught. "So what, the Germans got to the moon first and that just means space is over? What can we do? They can't just give up on the future!"\n\n"Nixon's already made his mind up. He wants to move the money over to the military and other 'practical projects'". Webb paused as Glenn made an outraged intake of breath. "I really don't think there's anything that can stop him at this point. I'm sorry, John."\n\nGlenn felt himself back in the rivierre of space flight.

I was distraught, to say the least, to know that the government was giving up on the future of space travel. Partly because the thought of never going up there myself again is saddening to consider, but that's not the only reason.\n\n"By ending our involvement in space, President Nixon has given up. He has accepted stagnation and decline, abandoning the stars to the fascist powers. He says we 'lost' the space race, but as long as the stars still shine space will never be lost. I implore that the President reconsider his options. The future of America, and the human species as a whole, lies above us."\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, Glenn made his closing remarks, and was greeted with raucous applause. He felt satisfied that his words had hit their mark, and with so many journalists in attendance tomorrow's papers would carry them further still. Yet he still felt defeated. His words alone would not be enough to save NASA.\n\nIf American space travel was to have a future, it would need a voice to represent it in the halls of power. John Glenn had never been one for politics, but as he thought on it, he realised that political office may be his best course of seeing his dream fulfilled.

This was perhaps the third time he had explained this simple concept to the assembled senators, and many were listening intently, but Lyndon B. Johnson had chosen to enact his characteristic bullish persona to derail the discussion.\n\n"And I also say it's pretty simple - that you are wasting time arguing over which metal we base our currency on. Last I checked, America was still an economic giant by all accounts, so I really fail to see the merit of this passion project of yours." Johnson scoffed as he leaned informally against his desk, and Bennett felt his blood pressure steadily rise at the lack of respect.\n\n"We can be so much stronger though, Mr Johnson.

We know that this has occurred because of the efforts of a coordinated Japanazi plot to replace our free republic with a National Socialist collectivist autocracy. They have carried out this plot through the use of their "useful idiots"; the integrationists, the NPP-L, the NPP-C, the Republican-Democratic Party and presidents Nixon and Eisenhower, all the Kennedy brothers and especially the family patriarch, and all those who have sought to weaken the United States through implementing liberal, communistic policies that will sow chaos and discord and leave us helpless before the Japanazi onslaught.\n\nThere is only one political leader in this country who I can say with complete confidence is not a part of this National Socialist conspiracy. That man is George C. Wallace. This man flew bombing missions against the Japanese in the war and never gave up that fight, not even after America was stabbed in the back by that Japanazi stooge President Truman at Akagi. He has now taken the anti-fascist and anti-communist struggle from the Pacific skies to the town halls of America, and is the lone voice speaking up for State's Rights, free speech, free enterprise, and all those rights which our Founding Fathers enshrined in the Constitution. He is not afraid to stand against the Nazi-created "Civil Rights movement" and its anti-constitutional demands and has wrested the National Progressive Party from the control of the Japanazi agents in the Center Bloc.\n\nWallace is the last and the best hope for the United States of America. He will cleanse this fair land of all German and Japanese political influences and lock up all their agents in America. Only Wallace stands up for America, therefore I stand for Wallace.

After a state funeral authorized by the President, he will be laid to rest in Norfolk, Virginia.\n\nMacArthur has a contested and complicated legacy; he had served in France in the First World War, as Superintendent of West Point, served as part of the court-martial of General Billy Mitchell. After he was assigned to the Philippines, during which he became the youngest American Major General at the age of 44, and was appointed Army Chief of Staff in 1930, and after leaving that post was named the Field Marshal of the semi-independent Philippine Army in 1935. But his role in putting down the Bonus Army of WW1 veterans in 1932, and his failure to prevent the Japanese from occupying the Philippines left his reputation in tatters. It was the latter that resulted in his dismissal by President Joseph Kennedy, and has since been considered either the "man that lost the Pacific" or as a scapegoat for the failed American war effort against Japan. He used his new civilian role to try to rally the American people to fight the war, but his constant criticism of President's Kennedy and Harry Truman alienated him from politicians and the general public, especially when he made comments favorably admiring Asian cultures and peoples later in the war.\n\nThe General's detractors considered him egotistical, aloof and pretentious, while others called him courageous, intelligent, and inspiring. Many National Progressive Party members and leaders have long believed that MacArthur could have won the war against Japan had he been properly supported. But that is a question that will never be answered."

Other marches throughout the US have also taken place with similar demands to end the war and bring our soldiers home. The most striking image was the sight of thousands of men and women, in single file, carrying placards with the name of a dead or wounded American soldier, or a town or village in South Africa that had been destroyed, marching in single file down Pennsylvania Avenue, past the White House, before reaching the Capitol Building.\n\nThe Moratorium is a different kind of protest: it's not left-wing "hippies" denouncing the draft and leading to violence and riots. Instead, the South African Moratorium Committee sought support from "respectable" institutions like the civil rights movement, churches, university faculties, unions, business leaders, and politicians. Some of those that spoke in the big Washington march include Coretta Scott King, Dr. Benjamin Spock, David Dellinger, W. Averell Harriman, and Arthur Goldberg. One news reporter has called the marches taking place "...a sober, almost melancholy manifestation of middle class concern..."\n\nIt's difficult to say if the presence of so many thousands of everyday Americans will change the country's policy regarding South Africa, with some supporters of the President are claiming that the protests are actually a Nazi ploy, simply to undermine the efforts to fight fascism, a new "America First" committee to undermine the nation's democratic resolve. Some White House staffers are sure that a "silent majority" actually does support the President in the current path forward.

One morning, a couple clad in bright floral shirts and brown khaki shorts walked in through the front door.\n\n'Hoela seeñor' the husband greeted him, butchering the simple phrase in such an obscene manner that Pablo could do nothing other than stare blankly at him. 'I have a reservation under the name Johnson, we would like to check in now' he continued.\n\n'Of course sir' Pablo responded. 'Let me just see our ledger book for a moment'. As he shot his finger down across the book, he did find a reservation under that name, with a checkout date scheduled for 10 days later. 'Very well then, here are your keys'.\n\n'Moochass grasias' they say as a steely chill runs down Pablo's body. He looks at the clock to the right of him, it's 10:45 in the morning."

Before the war, he would go there to unwind from working at the St. George city hall, but now he spends most of the day as a patron of it. The fall of the British government, and the American navy's arrival in Bermuda, made his job more than a little obsolete. As he put his empty coffee cup down, his cousin Paul came over to collect it.\n\n'Everything alright mate?' he asks as he wipes down the table.\n\n'Same as every other day I suppose.' he responds.

I WANNA WEAR THAT SMOKEY BEAR'.\n\nDirectly adjacent to the pair, a group of US Navy Seals was undergoing one of their routine exercise drills. They counted around fifteen men, all dressed in green and blue military fatigues, who were led by a drill instructor. Most of the time, the Yanks would use the outer roads for this sort of thing, but they would also sometimes come into the towns, due to the low amounts of traffic.

USA.flavor.14.desc:0 "Washington, D.C. has always had a rather interesting relationship inside the United States. As the capital of the nation, it isn't officially part of any state, instead a district governed by the US Congress as a whole to ensure that any local government couldn't overpower the federal seat. When it was a half-built, swampy square of land where few lived if they could help it, this presented few problems. But as the nation grew, so did Washington, and with over 750,000 people living within its borders, more than 11 states in the Union from the 1960 Census, it seemed hypocritical that the population of the capital of the world's most important democracy shouldn't be able to vote for their leaders.!\n\nThe recently passed 23rd Amendment has changed that. The citizens of Washington, D.C., now have the right to vote in Presidential elections, granting them no more electoral votes than the smallest state in the union, so just three electoral votes for the 1964 election. The city is a buzz of activity, as voter registration drives are taking place and polling stations in school gymnasiums, fire stations and community centers are taking place, as a high turnout is expected among the residents and citizens of the city.\n\nFor many, this is a long time coming, a historical in-justice finally righted. For others, this is only the first step. For while they can now vote for the resident of the White House, other avenues of political representation are missing: DC gets no member in the House of Representatives, nor the two senators that the other 50 states have, and no ability to help change the constitution that had so long denied them their rights. Washington doesn't even have it's own mayor, instead the city is overseen by a disinterested committee of Congress. So there is still work to be done."

The gangways were raised, and off came a few groups of passengers, but nowhere near the number that the great ship could hold. The smoke from the twin funnels dwindled as the engines were shut off, and the lights were eventually turned off.\n\nSeventeen years before, the crowds were much larger, more jubilant, as the SS United States left New York on its maiden voyage. Designed by the famed naval architect William Francis Gibbs, the United States was the largest passenger ship ever built in America, as well as one of the safest. She was virtually fireproof, with aluminum, asbestos and fiberglass composing almost everything inside the ship. Only the butcher's block in the kitchen and a grand, mahogany piano were the only wooden furnishings allowed on board.\n\nBesides her size and safety, she was fast. She made the trans-Atlantic crossing in three days, 10 hours and 40 minutes at an average speed of over 35 knots, capturing the coveted Blue Riband for the fastest ship crossing the Atlantic.\n\nDespite the subsidies provided by the American Government so she could be turned into a troopship in the event of war, the United States hasn't turned a profit in years. The lack of passenger travel between the US and Europe, and the arrival of new passenger jetliners that can cross the ocean in a fraction of the time of even the world's fastest ship has sounded the death knell of the ocean trade.\n\nWhat the future holds for this great liner remains to be seen."

If you looked in an atlas, cartographers would have tried to outline where the biggest warlord groups were, but that changed every year, sometimes over a week as one group would rise in power and another decline. She didn't envy that thankless, never ending job.\n\n"Well, Mary, that is where Russia used to be," Mrs. Denson replied.\n\n"Why isn't there a Russia anymore?" Mary asked.\n\n"It's complicated," Mrs. Denson replied, before flipping open her book to continue talking about the curriculum mandated discussion of Manifest Destiny.\n\n"But isn't that history, and we are in a history class?" Mary asked again.\n\nMrs. Denson sighed. "Okay. Short version, from what I know: the Germans defeated the Soviet Union in the war, but didn't take over the whole country, leaving the rest to be fought over.

His presidency was supposed to be the antidote to that toxic ideology, the proof that evidence-based policies will always be superior to the vices of populism.\n\nBut now, his entire mindset started to unravel. Mrs. "I would have nuked Japan for what they did to Hawaii" decisively beat him in the election, and the preceding weeks have been nothing but a dim blur. Bennett continued to fulfill his duty and administered the country as usual, but without any greater purpose or vision - he went through the motions, nothing more and nothing less.\n\nTime went by fast. The final day arrived faster than it was meant to. Smith arrived with a small entourage of advisers, going through all of the polite formalities. She said "Of course, Mr. President" and "Thank you, Mr. President", but her sheer contempt for him was simply impossible to conceal. Bennett knew why - he was weak, he lacked the resolve to stand up against Japan, Germany or even just the NPP. Now, he was due to be swept aside by the tides of history, replaced by a woman poised to assert American interests on a global stage.\n\nThe meeting went as long as it was planned to, almost entirely adhering to his script.

The wooden Resolute desk was as magnificent as ever, the plaster seal on the ceiling was impressive, if a bit kitschy, and Honest Abe still looked at him with his legendary smile. Everything was just as it was supposed to be, but one flaw shattered that serene image - a massive black stain ruined the beautiful hardwood floor. \n\nBennett didn't know how it got there - maybe some cleaning lady dropped something she shouldn't have dropped, or one of his guests came in with dirty shoes. All he knew was that the stain existed since at least 1965, and over all the years, Bennett could never find an opportunity to remove it. Sure, he had his reasons - visitors had to be welcomed, meetings had to be held, and much more. There was simply no time left to deal with that, especially considering that the entire floor would likely have to be replaced just for that one spot.\n\n He could have removed it, but he didn't. He left it alone for years, and now, it almost seemed like it was growing, seeping deeper and deeper into the foundation of the building.\n\nBennett sighed and went back to work, crunching numbers and formulating long-winded memos to federal departments the average citizen has never heard of.

All of their letters are filled with valid concerns, justified demands and hopeful pleas. Every single one of them was unique and thoughtfully written, but they all blended into each other after some time, like a uniform mass of paper and ink . \n\nHarrington was almost done with his daily allotment when one letter caught his eye. It was a simple letter - both the postage stamp and the envelope were the usual ones you could buy at your local USPS station, and the return address was handwritten with a pencil. Among the heap of elaborate signatures and luxurious, impregnated envelopes, it stuck out like a sore thumb - it was the "other letter", in a way. Intrigued, Harrington picked it up and opened it. A barely legible scribble awaited him, which he could only decipher with some trouble: \n\n"Dear Mr. President, \n\nThank you so much for giving my school more money!

Whenever he watched klansman march through the streets, whenever he drove through the neglected streets of the Bronx, whenever he watched that empty suit known as Martin Luther King spout empty platitudes about forgiveness and love, he felt like was going to snap. Reciting that mantra in his head dozens, hundreds of times sort of dampened the seething hot rage deep within him, but it didn't fully extinguish it - it merely funneled it into productive thoughts, a fervent drive that turned him into one of America's biggest civil rights advocates through nothing but his own labor.\n\nHowever, the comfortable knowledge of the fact that the eternal oppressors would get their just desserts in Jahannam wasn't enough for Malcom. He had no patience for the afterlife - he longed for racial justice in this world instead of the afterlife, and he dedicated his entire life to this cause, going as far as to change his surname to highlight the systemic destruction of West African culture waged by the institutions of slavery. No actions were too radical, no words were too dangerous when it came to dismantling the century old white supremacy that defined the United States since their inception.\n\nMalcolm X made lots of enemies over the years. Millions of people want him gone, and he already came to terms with the facts that his death will likely not be a natural one.

Over the past few years, he  has been rather occupied with worldly matters, but recent events finally enabled him to take a week off - there was much to be done, but the situation wasn't as desperate as before.\n\nThe city was an everlasting tornado of different peoples, a place where the world came together as one to worship the great god above it all. Malcolm shared his accommodation  with a Bosnian, slaughtered a lamb with a Turk, and attempted to explain his role in the civil rights movement to an Indonesian grandfather, and even though his monologue was barely intelligible due to his rather lacking grasp on Arabic, he still felt like he bonded with him on a rather spiritual level.\n\nWas this what Hajj is really all about? Malcolm circled the cube and kissed the rock like he was supposed to, but the real purpose of Hajj was to embrace the ummah and transcend the barriers that divide believers from each other - the real Hajj was the friends he made along the way. Maybe Martin Luther King had a point - if racial equality can be achieved in Mecca, it could surely also be achieved in America.\n\nIn retroperspective, the Nation of Islam did seem like a rather impious and overly revanchistic organisation. Perhaps it was time to distance from it, to abandon the hate-filled clique in favor of the one true denomination -  Sunni Islam.\n\nSome of his old brothers in faith might take grave offense to that, likening his revelation to apostasy and treason.

Pressures from Berlin and Tokyo have caused a cave-in for the fragile political structure of the once-proud nation. However, the people have started to speak out against tyranny, and our shining opportunity is developing itself right before our eyes. The National Front, formerly outlawed under the Shah's one-party dynasty, has made a resurgence in the local population, and every class seems to show its support: farmers, soldiers, and noblemen alike. In a surprising referendum directed at the parliament, the people demanded free elections, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, among others. The result? Over two hundred "freedom fighters" dead, over a thousand wounded. Angered at this sight, democratic politicians continued to speak out against the Shah, all while building up a competent army in the southern half of the country along the Zagros Mountains and the Persian coast. A constitution was signed and the new Republic of Iran seceded only a few hours ago.\n\nPersia is the gate through which the Caucasus, India, Central Asia, and the Middle East can be accessed. We also don't want the barbaric German eagle spreading his talons over the oil reserves in Iran. With a friendly government, any chance the Germans have at filling up their Panzers with Persian oil is slim. If the Liberals win this conflict, they could be our "experiment" with democracy in the region, a beacon of hope for the peoples of the Middle East. We must be hasty; the frail democracy is already on the defensive."

Furthermore, this bill ensures our lasting cooperation with the Republic of Iran, and we are now committed to keeping the candle lit for as long as possible.\n\nAlready, as the money flows into the newly established nation, the locals have been praising us for our swift efforts. We have also been getting positive reports from the population here, and it seems people are more eager to combat oppression in Iran than in any other war in the past decade.

Our troops are much more trained and ready than the Liberal troops. Americans may die on the battlefield but the overall number of casualties will be lower than if we only sent weapons. Officers supporting indirect involvement claim that if the U.S. Army lands on Persian soil, it could bring Germany or Japan into the conflict, and that is certainly not in our best interests. The public isn't showing support for this kind of intervention either, and it would take a resounding victory to even dent their disapproval.\n\nThe advisers supporting indirect involvement claim that, first and foremost, less Americans will be sacrificed for freedom. We can trust that the Iranians are capable of using the latest technologies we have to offer. The introduction of our arsenal is enough of a boost for the National Front troops. The Germans and Japanese are less likely to intervene if we only send supplies. Critics believe this will produce a larger death toll and the war will be drawn out longer.\n\nWe either send troops and risk it all or we trust the National Front to take care of the job using our technology."

This time, the U.S. must decide whether its soldiers will attempt a swift advance to end the war or prepare for the long haul war of attrition. If we send enough soldiers in to overwhelm the enemy, there is a clear chance the war would end once Tehran capitulates. However, if this advance fails, there will be a monumental loss of American life, and the war might as well be lost. It is a big risk, but if our troops can pull it off, the war will be won handily and we have our Middle Eastern ally.\n\nAlternatively, we can expect the long-term war from the start and try to wear down our foe over time. The war may be longer, but we would have no risk of failing and embarrassing ourselves on the world stage again. At the same time, there would be no chance of a swift victory. This route allows for a greater conservation of resources and all our soldiers would have to do is hold out longer. The idea may not sit well with the average soldier, but it is meant to keep him safe.\n\nIn conclusion, our military either risks the entire operation on one single offensive, or we hold everything in the trenches and wait for the enemy to attack us.

 USA.culture.1.desc:0 "A spokesman for the Kennedy family reports today that former president Joseph P. Kennedy passed away in his Massachusetts home at 81. He is survived by his wife and six children.\n\nThe elder Kennedy leaves behind a complicated legacy. His success as patriarch of the Kennedy dynasty was substantial, as his sons John, Robert, and Edward all made names for themselves in the political sphere. The elder Kennedy was elected president in 1932 and presided over the slow recovery of the United States from the Great Depression. Despite serious criticisms for his non-interventionist policy, both in economic and foreign policy, he won a second term in 1936.\n\nThis second term was mainly defined by Kennedy's continued reluctance to intervene in the European war, and failure to fully prepare the United States for global power projection against Japan or Germany. Kennedy was the source of much criticism in the aftermath of his presidency, which only increased after the failed intervention in England and the signing of the Akagi Accords by his successor, Harry Truman. The Democrats would not hold the White House for another two decades, when his son, John F. Kennedy, succeeded the disgraced President Richard Nixon.\n\nKennedy had spent the years after the presidency retired from public life, having lost his son Joe Jr. in a bombing raid over the Pacific, but he reemerged to help with his son's bid for the vice presidency. However, the elder Kennedy kept himself out of the public eye, due to widespread criticism of comments he made advocating detente with Germany to focus on confronting Japan, and refused to help with his son Robert's presidential run in 1964.\n\nRegardless of how the American people remember him, Kennedy left a lasting mark on the nation's history, and his family will most likely continue to have a major role in politics for the foreseeable future."

 USA.culture.3.desc:0 "It seemed as soon as the boat docked at the Norfolk, VA port that Jonathan Stafford, soldier of the 134th "Jayhawk" Plains Division, would finally find peace after years of turmoil in the South African War. He was born to a poor farming couple in central Kansas and learned to drive a tractor when he was only seven years old. His skill with a rifle came when he crossed the border into Arkansas and began hunting wild hogs to feed his mother and father. When he turned eighteen he was faced with a dilemma: either join the Army and provide parents a substantial income, or stay on the farm for eternity. Once the recruiters arrived at the farm, Jonathan's parents would not see their son again for another six years.\n\nTraining came and went, and before he knew it, Jonathan's division was sent off to Port Elizabeth. The Jayhawk Division, organized in Kansas, was well-prepared for the lowly plains of South Africa, but mastering the terrain was only one step in the process of combat. Stafford himself was involved in several offensives against the Germans and pulled together several kills, but his involvement ended when he was shot in the shoulder. While he was being taken to cover, an advancing German shot another two bullets into his wrist and hand. The wounds were not fatal and Stafford fully recovered, but, much to his chagrin, he was sent back home.\n\nNow, Stafford was a very proud American, and he hoped the general public would hail him as a hero who fought for his country. To put it bluntly, he received the exact opposite: protesters spat on him, threw dirt in his face, and even tried to frame him for murder. Students from Kansas State found his address and attempted to set his parents' farm ablaze, but police arrested them before they could act. The public response to Stafford's actions was possibly even more scarring than his experience in the war."

However, not one story had gained as much attention as Hal Moore's We Were Young Soldiers. A New York Times bestseller in its first three weeks of publication, the novel chronicles Colonel Hal Moore's adventures as a commander in 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry.\n\n"The savanna was harsh, hot, and desperately in need of action. Laying in the bushes for hours on end was grueling, but if you were tired of being on the ground, the Germans were not afraid to shoot. Sometimes they'd shoot anyway. I couldn't imagine how frightened my men must have been."\n\nOne thrilling part of the novel focuses on Moore's successful gamble to ambush an important German position, and how it resulted in twenty German deaths and a hundred captured POWs. The superb commentary of the event was likened to that of Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage, and reviewers have considered it one of the greatest military novels of all-time.

Of how a US Air Force general, gone completely insane and thinking the Japanese were destroying America from within by destroying "precious bodily fluids" with fluoride, could order a nuclear strike on them? To American audiences, the thought that someone could just order a nuclear attack on a whim was something that could only happen from Germania or Tokyo, not in the good ol' USA. The flailing efforts to recall the bombers, and the German revelation of a Doomsday Device that would kill all life on earth as the bombers head for Japan just further confounds the audience's expectations. The movie showed that everyone, from the unnamed yet all powerful and raving Nazi Fuhrer and the over-ceremonial puppet Japanese Emperor were just as incompotent as any corrupt politican elected in the US, especially in the face of nuclear armageddon...\n\n...Yet, "Dr. Strangelove" is much more than a surreal look at mid-20th Century fears of nuclear war. It will be recognized by future generations as a classic of filmmaking. Kubrick's obsessive attention to detail in everything from the camera work to the exact facial expressions of the actors on screen. The brilliant acting of Peter Sellers in three separate roles: as a British emigre RCAF officer who tries to restrain the American general, the unready and soft-spoken President of the US thrust into a diplomatic crisis, and the creepy and comedic Dr. Strangelove, a Russian scientist who has some crazy ideas of how to rebuild the US in the aftermath of the now inevitable nuclear war involving cross-breeding people with plants. The over the top and hammy acting of George C. Scott as he reveals just how the world was to end with American B-52's flying low over the Kanto Plains, with his arms stretched out and making sound effects with his mouth. The cowboy riding the bomb down like a bull at a Texas rodeo to obliterate a Japanese military base, and finally the montage of nuclear bombs exploding to the haunting "Maybe" by The Ink Spots...\n\n...it is, perhaps, the perfect dark comedy: funny in the face of terror, horrifying despite the levity. It brings in stark contrast the idea of Mutually Assured Destruction to an audience that just didn't quite comprehend the fact that a nuclear war will be the last war.

Drawing from their failures with the Pinto, Ford set out to effectively downsize their flagship muscle car into a form suiting the American family's increasingly tight purses.\n\nThe end result is the second-generation Mustangs, or the Mustang IIs, released with aplomb today.

 USA.culture.19.desc:0 "The previous two decades have been rough on the United States of America: being on the losing end of the Second World War, giving up key ports in California to the enemy, watching Europe and Russia fall to the jackboot, utterly powerless. Worst of all, our own red-blooded Americans were struck by the most powerful weapon the world had ever seen: twenty years ago today, Pearl Harbor was destroyed, wiped from the face of Earth by the atomic bomb. December 7th, 1941 was another devastating day, as two thousand lives were lost upon America's entry into the war. The base was the place of death for tens of thousands of brave men and women who gave their lives for freedom's cause.\n\nThe construction of the Pearl Harbor Monument in Washington, D.C. lasted three years, and opening day has finally arrived. Thousands flocked to the capital to view statues of soldiers raising the American flag, replicas of American battleships, and the centerpiece of the monument: a large "peace fountain" that contained the names of every soldier known to have died in the Pearl Harbor attacks. Gardens were also planted in honor of the fallen soldiers, and it quickly became the site of mourning throughout the area.\n\nFlowers were left at the base of the fountain, coins littered the fountain floor. For the Americans who had no flowers to give nor coins to donate, they gave the utmost respect for the fallen soldiers who perished in the face of destruction. Even a handful of exceptionally patriotic Americans claimed that "America would have her vengeance". No matter one's beliefs, tonight is a night of remembrance."

As Torontonians rub their chins in anxiety, their hometown Maple Leafs, the defending Stanley Cup champions, duke it out with the Detroit Red Wings. Men slide across the ice, making epic leaps and clever backhands, dueling with their sticks in a display of speed that brings to mind a shell game. One moment, they swarm around each other, desperately trying to assess the other team's next move. The next, it's an epic dash across the arena. Detroit is resentful. They've only won one game out of five in this final, and the fans, in their hearts, know that tonight could be the end of the line. Two nights ago, they had pelted the Leafs with paper cups and programs after the game. The air tastes bitter.\n\nIn the second period, Maple Leaf centre Dave Keon manages to swing across the blue line and around Alex Delvecchio, giving Toronto its first goal of the night. Not long after, though, Marcel Pronovost scores for Detroit. But with seven minutes to go, Toronto winger Eddie Shack, a foul-mouthed born entertainer with a penchant for sparking brawls on the ice, manages to break the tie with a deflection shot, giving the Maple Leafs their second straight Stanley Cup.\n\nWith a graceful "swish" across the ice and into the net, the crowd leaps from their seats. The Maple Leafs have won. Toronto has won. Canada has won."

Much like the frontier, Adriatica is rife with outlaws and constabularies, saloons of sin and banks of marble, and poor settlers caught in the middle as they toil a miserable living out of sands streaked with blood and oil. Never in the present has there been a depiction of this mythical age truer than Italy's youngest province.\n\nItalian filmmaker Sergio Leone demonstrated his awareness of such when he released For a Few Dollars More late this year. Featuring up-and-coming Hollywood actor Clint Eastwood as a rough, tough-speaking mercenary, the movie brought new life to an old genre while introducing its own refreshing themes. Standoffs between lawmen and bandits in desolate mining towns were joined with the ambitions of laconic bounty hunters and long-held grudges, tied together in a captivating plot centered around a heist. Though the film depicted America's Old West, the conflicts it had shown resonated with the Italian pioneers seeking their fortunes in their country's new frontier.\n\nDespite less than stellar reception from film critics for its over-the-top violence and "campy" tone, the film nevertheless broke records by reaching $4 million in ticket sales in Italy by year's end. North America added an extra $14 million to the film's gross revenue, proving that there is a place for the now-termed "Spaghetti Western" in the Free World's silver screens. Already rumors abound of a sequel, and directors and studios hint of filming their own reimaginations of a bygone era in the very same savannahs that evinced its stories in the hearts and minds of millions."

Critics from the Chicago Sun-Times have regarded the movie as being "a brilliant showcasing of the depth of investigative journalism, as paranoia, self-doubt, and harassment dominate the cases of the heroes of the Washington Post." The movie soared to reach a cemented number one spot at the box office as Americans rushed to see the political thriller.\n\nDirector Alan J. Pakula provides the American audience a journey across the spheres of journalism, writing, and politics as the film looks into the journeys of renowned reporting duo Katharine Graham and David Halberstam as they take on the haunting shadows which peer over their every move. Together, the duo follows one step after another in the journey to unveil a secretive and dangerous conspiracy involving the White House administration, scaling all the way up to former President Richard Nixon himself, who, just two years ago, resigned from his office as President of the United States. Graham and Halberstam served as writing leads behind the movie itself, with Graham stating that "David and I wanted to deliver a trek through the perils that came with the Nixon scandal as we had experienced: terrifying, back-breaking, and, well, exhilarating. As every time we felt our hearts' racing, we wanted the audience to feel that rush just the same."\n\nThat being said, key figures within the Republican-Democrat Party have come forward in criticism of the movie, with the Republican-Democrats stating that "it puts a hole through our work in trying to help the United States." Meanwhile, spokespersons within the National Progressive Party have stated their "appreciation within Graham, Halberstam, and Pakula's work."

Its don, Vito Corleone, is an honorable and respected Sicilian immigrant. His position among New York's Five Families, though, is being threatened by the growing heroin trade. This conflict spirals into a bloody gang war, which claims Sonny, Vito's eldest child. After Vito promises to end the war, his second son, Michael, a veteran of Scotland, begins to take control of the Corleone empire. In 1955, Vito dies, and Michael exacts his revenge on the Five Families in a vicious series of assassinations, establishing his status as the new Godfather of the Mafia.\n\n"The Godfather" has garnered rave reviews. Critics around the country are praising the performances of the legendary Marlon Brando as Vito, and the budding young Al Pacino as Michael. Others have acclaimed the score, editing, and the themes of immigration and family, seeing it as a parable for America's complicated relationship to Italy.

To a man he and his fellow unionmen agreed: America had a moral obligation to protect democracy from fascism's encroachments not just at home, but also abroad. Dissent from the war effort was tantamount to treason. So with their hard hats, Old Glories and steel-toed boots, two hundred construction workers coalesced into a counter-protest in Federal Hall to profess their unconditional patriotism.\n\nAll that kept a semblance of order was a thin, shaky border of policemen sandwiched between two raucuous mobs.

The only somewhat enjoyable song on the entire album is "Good Vibrations," which was released as a single by the band back in October and hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nWhere fans see esoteric genius, critics see an incomprehensible mess. Where detractors hear the ramblings of an over-drugged burnout, supporters hear the enlightenment of a tortured soul. This embittered back-and-forth between critics has only served to drive more people to buy the album and see what all the fuss is about, propelling it further and further up the charts. Billboard estimates a gold certification is mere weeks away."

 USA.culture.41.t:0 "Beach Boys Found Murdered!"
 USA.culture.41.desc:0 "Police were called to a house in Los Angeles's Beverly Crest neighborhood this morning after a housekeeper reported that the door was unlocked and she could see bloodstains inside. When they arrived, they discovered one of the most tragic and horrifying mass murders of the decade.\n\nBeach Boys members Brian Wilson, his brother Dennis, and cousin Mike Love were at record producer Terry Melcher's house on March 8th to celebrate the release of their latest album. Also in attendance were Brian's pregnant wife Marilyn, singer Mark Lindsay of the Raiders, and Melcher's mother, movie star Doris Day. During the night of March 8-9th, an unidentified group of people entered the property on foot after cutting the phone lines. Doris Day was leaving the party in her car and must have seen them; the car's front door was open and she was shot four times in the abdomen. The group then gained access to the front door through an open window and brought all the house's inhabitants to the living room. Brian Wilson and Melcher were stabbed multiple times to death, while Marilyn and Lindsay were found shot dead on the back porch, likely attempting to flee. Dennis Wilson's body was far more heinously killed compared to the others: he was shot in both his knees, his abdomen was stabbed over four dozen times, and his face was severely disfigured by blunt trauma. The words "thief" and "pig" were written in blood on the living room walls.\n\nThe only survivor of the event was Mike Love, who endured half a dozen knife wounds and being shot in the shoulder before passing out from blood loss. He is currently comatose in intensive care in Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Beverly Hills, and investigators hope he will wake soon and help identify the killers."

 USA.culture.42.t:0 "Beach Boys Ex-Associate Charged in Wilson-Melcher Murders"
 USA.culture.42.desc:0 "This morning, Charles Manson was charged with first degree murder in the aftermath of the terrifying killings that gripped the nation last March. Manson, a self-proclaimed guru with delusions of grandeur and a history of violent sex crimes, met Terry Melcher after a chance encounter with Beach Boys member Dennis Wilson. Wilson, hoping to aid Manson's dream of becoming a published folk musician, introduced him to Melcher, but they had a falling out due to Manson's violent and erratic behavior. Manson was already in LAPD custody for an unrelated petty crime when he was charged. His cult of followers, colloquially known as his "Family," earlier caught the FBI's attention for their leader's support of Francis Parker Yockey and preaching a bizarre synthesis of messianic apocalypticism and white supremacy. When questioned if his beliefs motivated the crime, Manson claimed that the murders were "all personal" and unrelated to his plans to "Wake the World"-his prophesied race war with its name taken from a Beach Boys song. According to Manson, Wilson adapted the lyrics to his song "Cease to Exist" without crediting him and deserved retribution.\n\nA court date is set, and a conviction is all but guaranteed due to band member Mike Love's agreement to testify after emerging from a coma last week. Love also announced that he and bandmates Carl Wilson, Al Jardine, and Bruce Johnston unanimously agreed to dissolve the band out of respect to Brian and Dennis's memory."

 USA.culture.43.t:0 "These are the Voyages..."
 USA.culture.43.desc:0 "Last night marked the season finale of American writer Gene Roddenberry's new science fiction phenomenon, Star Trek. Set in the distant future, the television program follows the starship U.S.S. Enterprise as it explores strange new worlds, and meets new civilizations. With the ability to travel faster than light, produce inanimate objects from thin air, as well as teleport from one place to another in an instant, the show presents a bright, idyllic future for mankind that has been found very welcome in the hearts of people around the world.\n\nIn the program, Mankind is the principal species of the United Federation of Planets, a democratic union of dozens of alien races. The Federation has eliminated hunger, poverty, and even the need for money. Among humanity, there exists no prejudice or hatred, and the crew of the Enterprise, in addition to having several alien representatives aboard, has crewmembers from America, Germany, Russia, Japan, and Africa.\n\nMany Americans and watchers abroad have found this vision of a glorious future for humanity to be a breath of fresh air in a sobering, dark reality. While some may say that such a bright vision is unrealistic, few can argue that it provides a glimmer of hope and in a world where such a resource is in desperately short supply."

 USA.culture.44.t:0 "Woodstock"
 USA.culture.44.desc:0 "The man on stage seemed to warp and then reform as he felt the strings of his guitar. Dozens of other men and women stood shirtless beside Eli as the sharp, echoing sound of an electric guitar colored the morning air. There was a raucous of noise and yells that seemed to blend into the background, in the same way that Eli almost felt himself blend into the hot, faceless mass of the crowd. People weren't quite so into it as they had been a few days ago, on Friday, but when Jimi Hendrix strummed that alabaster work of art, silence lay like a shadow.\n\nThe notes continued, and Eli felt his skin vibrate with goosebumps. Muscles wanted to pulse and groove in waves with the rhythm, but it was already clear this was not dancing music. He could almost hear the lyrics in his head, even though Jimi wasn't singing. The words of the Star-Spangled Banner seemed to be crushed or torn apart by Jimi's occasional bouts of speed followed by echoing, drawn-out chords. Eli wasn't entirely sure how much of this extraordinary performance was imagined, but he felt every little twist and riff ripple in his head and in his soul.\n\nJimi switched from somber, more connected-feeling chords into wild riffs and solos seemingly on a whim. Eli's eyes remained locked on the guitarist, and the rest of the world seemed to just melt away in whorls of color. Finally, it seemed like the hard and fast playing was beginning to morph into something more akin to what Eli knew and loved. Eli prayed that the Star and Stripes he saw in his mind's eye would never leave. He loved his country, he loved this place, and he hoped he would never have to leave."
