POLITICS_BOB_DESC:0 "Robert McNamara, President of the United States and arguably the most powerful person in the world, is not a passionate man. Years of quagmires abroad and at home have left him bitterly convinced that emotion is the death of reason. Without reason, there can be no stable democracy, and without stable democracy, there can be no America. Thus, if the nation is to survive the cold war in one piece, there can be no room for emotional compromises; efficiency and practicality rule above all. If military IQ standards must be lowered to allow for more recruitment, then they shall be lowered. If a foreign nation must be invaded to protect the American people, then it shall be invaded. If taxes must be raised to provide for the common defense, then they shall be raised. America's enemies do not share her pity, remorse, or fear; their politics demand that liberty must, so liberty must grow teeth of her own to ensure her survival.\n\nExceptionally well educated, with a long career in business before entering politics, McNamara has always championed efficiency over emotion, and now he stands in a uniquely strong position to execute his wishes upon the face of American politics. His plans include combining tax agencies, reforming the IRS to be less obtrusive to the average American, cutting the social safety net, and rapidly expanding federal power to satisfy his thirst for control. The more wasted money he can save from the incompetence of the United States government is more money he can use to bolster the country's military against the increasingly belligerent Germans and Japanese.\n\nNow, the question remains as to whether McNamara's ruthless efficiency and political practicality will be able to drain the swamp of Washington and transform America into the fearsome giant it once was, or fall flat on its face like so many before him. Regardless, any enemies of the United States would be wise to be wary of a man so detached from his emotional desires; such a man just might send the world tumbling into the abyss."

USA.1701.t:0 "The Giant Awakens"
USA.1701.d:0 ""My fellow Americans, I stand before you today, having taken the oath of office that our forefathers have taken for nearly two centuries. Within many of our lifetimes, we will live to see a third millennium. Before the celebrations of such milestones, it is important to reflect on how our nation is, and how it shall be. I swear to you America: we will be a greater nation upon these celebrations."\n\n"America, for decades, our government has been plagued by inefficiency: wasteful, expensive, and otherwise useless programs that have weighed down the true strength of our nation. For many years, this incompetence was not so important, for the nation was strong and her enemies were few. Now, however, when we are constantly standing upon the precipice of conflict with foreign powers, such programs cannot be afforded. America must stand strong, undivided, and without frivolous distraction, if we are to outlast our enemies."\n\n"Beyond pure survival, though, let us rejoice that, should our almighty God give us strength, I believe we shall rise unto a new age of American prosperity. Taxes and the infernally wasteful IRS shall be streamlined, hundreds of thousands of new jobs will be created, and near-every American shall be able to purchase a home and live in peace. You may hear these and believe them to be lofty goals, but I say they are quite achievable. All we need do is trim the fat from our government, and work as one united people.""

USA_bob_72_workwiththeparty_desc:0 "Since we won the election as a Republican-Democrat, it's only reasonable, prudent even, that we should be working within our coalition. First on the agenda is giving the military the resources it needs in order to improve itself. While we can always find more ways to cut inefficiencies and waste, sometimes more money for more training, more recruits, more planes and more boats is necessary. Then, once we have the muscle to flex, we can take an even stronger line against the Germans, who only respond to force. Well by God, we will have force!"

It's going to involve a lot of late nights, breaking down numbers, creating charts and formulas and, in the end, showing the best, most logical, most efficient way to secure America's defense and fortunes.\n\nThe old days of trying to make ideology fit into reality is over. Now we are using the cold, hard facts to maximize everything, especially when it comes to defense. The best place to station aircraft carriers. The most effective use of flybys to intimidate. The best training methods to ensure the minimization of American casualties and the maximization of our enemies. And, if necessary, the loopholes and grey areas of the current laws that we can use to our advantage.\n\nGet a pot of coffee on, it's going to be a long night."

USA_bob_72_layoutthevision_desc:0 "With the Republican-Democrats firmly behind us, it's time to get to work. The President has been working with senators from both parties on a sweeping bill to provide billions more to the military, to fund everything from new weapon systems, upgrading technology to become more capable, and investing in bettering the lives of our men in arms. But the largest aspect of the bill is to give the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency the leeway and funds to not only surpass the Germans and Japanese right now, but right into the next century. We will make America not only the strongest nation in the world militarily, but also the most forward thinking and advanced!"

USA_bob_72_appeasetherepublicans_desc:0 "While the Democrats may be on the upswing now that McNamara is in office, that doesn't mean that we can ignore the Republicans and their needs and desires entirely. In fact, that would make running the government that much harder and frictious, and that's the last thing the new President wants. Vice President Bayh has already an idea in mind to work with the GOP: the University and Small Business Patent Procedures Act. Ever since the federal government started giving grants to universities to help develop new technology, the debate over who actually owns the intellectual rights to the new developments has been a fraught one. This new bill will streamline it by giving the universities the chance to patent and profit off these inventions, since they did all the hard work. And the President is all for giving those that work hard on ideas and technologies to improve America's security and standard of living the right to prosper thanks to them."

Quiet and shy, he has a knack for details and can see many sides of the same issue, coming to the best conclusion after long thought. This is exactly the kind of man we need to oversee the Department of Defense. While Rusk's career so far has been in the State Department, President McNamara trusts him to negotiate the rivalries of the different branches of the military to work together to dual goals of defending America, and defending freedom.\n\nThe only opposition we have faced regarding Rusk's confirmation are from uber-pacifist Republicans like Senator McGovern, but they are the very, very small minority. Then again, they wouldn't like anyone to be sitting in the Pentagon unless they were a Hippie."

USA_bob_72_themcnamarapresidency_desc:0 "Robert McNamara is not who anyone would consider a charismatic politician. He's a numbers guy, having studied economics at the University of California, Berkeley and got an M.B.A. at Harvard before the war, and then serving in the Army Air Corps. He wasn't a pilot or front line officer, but conducted statistical analysis of bombers effectiveness, even as the Japanese pushed the Americans across the Pacific. After the war, and a stint in the upper levels of management at the Ford Motor Company, McNamara joined government service, working in the Department of Defense under multiple administrations, doing his best to make the US military the most efficient and effective in the world.\n\nNow, having experience in both the private sector, and turned the military into a finely honed machine ready to stand up to the Reich and the Rising Sun, he's ready to bring that experience to the nation as a whole. With the young and popular Birch Bayh as his Vice President handling the more public events, McNamara can do what he does best: crunch the numbers, find efficiencies, and turn the American government into a finely honed machine."

USA_bob_72_fillingthegovernment_desc:0 "The first call the new President is making is to George Shultz, a successful businessman who had served in several government roles over the previous decades, including on Eisenhower's Council of Economic Advisors, Secretary of Labor under Nixon, and an economic policy commentator and advisor over the years. This time, Schultz will be given the Treasury Department to run, so he will have some real power to go with his suggestions and plans. He also has strong opinions on foreign policy of the anti-fascist variety, which should make getting any budget increases we propose in the future to run through the bureaucracy that much smoother."
USA_bob_72_timetocleanhouse:0 "Time To Clean House"
USA_bob_72_timetocleanhouse_desc:0 "One of the problems with the old style of politics was that loyalty to the party and deference to ideology was the most important aspect of governing the nation, even if it didn't actually help America in the long term. President McNamara doesn't believe this: it's inefficient, values subservience to party more than competency in a subject, and leads to infighting and corruption. The best way, the only way, to run the country is to get the best people in the right positions, no matter their political leaning. The Republicans and Democrats may moan and complain as their candidates are shunted aside for non-political, or worse, NPP members, but it's all for the good of America. Nation over Party."

USA_bob_72_rallythedemocrats_desc:0 "The President is not a public speaker. McNamara is a numbers guy, and you can't convince stats with powerful words, nor can you change mathematical facts with soaring rhetoric. His words will never enter the pantheon of great American speeches like Washington, Lincoln or Kennedy. But when he does have something to say, and something that he can't simply hand to Bayh to do, it has to be important. And uniting the Democrats, to ensure they are all on the same page to support his administration, is just one such effort. While the speech he is giving to the Democrats invited to the East Room is full of cliches ("the best is yet to come!") and a couple awkward turns of phrase ("It won't be easy, it will be hard, it may even be difficult"), there is no doubt of the sincerity behind it, and his ideological allies are all the more supportive that he at least made the effort."

Now that the groundwork has been laid, it's time to make official the new McNamara Doctrine. It will not be simply an address to the nation like previous Presidents have done to outline their foreign policy, but it will become ironclad law. We will use our democratic institutions to show to America's enemies what they will soon be facing.\n\nI'd be quivering in my jackboots already!"
USA_bob_72_callinthewhizkids:0 "Call Up The Whiz Kids"
USA_bob_72_callinthewhizkids_desc:0 "In his time serving in the Nixon Administration, Robert McNamara had developed professional relationships, even friendships, with a variety of young, talented and incredibly smart men that soon became known as the "Whiz Kids" within the Federal Government. While they didn't have the top roles in government twelve years ago, working as Under-Secretaries or backroom specialists and analysts, now they are more than qualified to implement modern management systems into the government, focusing on the fields of economic analysis, operations research, game theory, and computing.\n\nAdam Yarmolinsky, William Kaufmann, and Charles Rossotti are just a few of the business executives and intellectuals that will be given high roles in the government, to bring a modern sensibility to the tired mechanics of government. The old timers and civil servants that rely more on patronage and not causing waves may not be too thrilled to be working under these new and radical ideas, but it's the President's decision, not theirs. So they better adapt or get out of the way."

While, yes, the R-D's developed a campaign platform on internal affairs, McNamara is going to leave that quagmire up to Vice President Bayh and Congress to sort out. No, he's focused on the big picture, the whole world.\n\nThe only other people in Washington that cares as much about foreign policy as McNamara does is the National Progressive Party, who are as committed to anti-Fascism as he is. It may be heretical to the President's party, and may require having to agree to slashing welfare, or unsustainably increasing it to get one wing or another onside with his foreign policy, but that's for everyone else to worry about. As long as America is united in defense of democracy and freedom abroad, who cares?"

While they may not agree on much else politically, McNamara is willing to overlook that, to provide bipartisan support to his agenda. The Republicans may not like it, since they aren't going to get one of their guys to be the head of the Pentagon, but it will play well to the rest of the nation. The charts and polls show that."

"I want your honest opinion: can this be done?"\n\n"It's not a matter of can - it's a matter of necessity, Mr. President." Rusk didn't bat an eye before responding. "So many Beltway insiders say that nuclear weapons have made major power war obsolete, Mr. President. But in my experience, the road to fighting facism starts well before that point. It will be in the steppes of Manchuria, the South African veldt, the jungles of Indonesia."\n\nRusk leaned forward. "If America wants to win the Cold War, we'll have to fight on the peripheries of the world - with everything but nuclear weapons.

The Administration's approach to military affairs is suffused with statistical analyses and quantitative methods from the heights of grand strategy to the nuts and bolts of equipment procurement, envisioning an expansive force perfectly tailored for the battlefield of the future.\n\nObjections to the bill on the Senate floor were predominantly focused on the cost of President McNamara's military programs, with a force both qualitatively and quantitatively superior to its enemies being prohibitively expensive to field. Administration officials dismissed these concerns, noting that the American people had elected the President with a mandate to ensure American victory in the Cold War, and that the Administration would employ its same statistical methods to ensure cost-effectiveness in the pursuit of military superiority."

Not only was it the brainchild of an unprecedented bipartisan effort - uniting President McNamara's brain trust of advisors with the most hawkish elements within the National Progressive Party - it's DOM provision (Deployment, Overseas Military) authorizes the 'limited' deployment of American military units overseas, at the President's discretion.\n\nThe bill has had the unusual effect of uniting dovish segments of the NPP with constitutionalists within the R-D's in opposition to the bill, concerned that the FREE Act and the DOM provision would erode Congress' power to declare and oversee foreign conflicts in the pursuit of military adventurism overseas. The McNamara Administration's backers have responded that, nearly a decade after the German Civil War and the Japanese economic crash, America will need to be able to respond quick and decisively to new developments in order to secure its advantage in the Cold War."

Social democrats within the NPP and fiscal hawks within the R-D's waged a successful campaign arguing against waste within the government and questioning the need to spend so much money on overseas military adventures even as the Oil Crisis continues to roil the domestic economy.\n\nAdministration officials put a brave face following the defeat, vowing that the President remained 'determined to secure American interests worldwide with the resources available.'

The bill's stated rationale to 'clarify and streamline the President's powers to conduct foreign and defense policy' - and its 'Deployment, Overseas Military' (DOM) provision, authorizing limited overseas military deployments at the President's discretion - provoked heated opposition from doves within the NPP and constitutionalists within the R-Ds.\n\nThe floor debate continued for hours, and eventually the opposition's argument that the FREE-DOM Act would gut Congress' constitutional role in declaring and prosecuting armed conflicts gained the upper hand, with the bill's backers failing to mount a spirited defense in the final hours of debate. The Administration - and the bill's backers in the NPP - refused to comment after the vote, and political analysts expect a prolonged period of internal party wrangling within both the R-D's and the NPP."

############ Bennett Response

POLITICS_WALLACE_F_BENNETT_DESC:0 "Wallace Foster Bennett: America's best hope for a stable future. Born in Salt Lake City to a pair of devout Mormons, Bennett's upbringing was heavily influenced by the tenets of his parents' faith. After a brief stint in the Army as an instructor, he married the youngest daughter of the Mormon President and began a career in business, eventually owning a successful Ford dealership. Like many ambitious men who had accomplished all their goals, Bennett chose to go into politics, being elected Senator for Utah in 1951, albeit under a cloud of controversy after accusing his opponent of being a closet communist.\n\nQuickly becoming a small-government and pro-business stalwart in the Senate, Bennett was soon entrenched as a major force in Washington pushing for conservative values. As the years wore on and America continued to stagnate, Bennett became convinced of the necessity to restore the nation's vitality, his conviction bolstered by Nixon's disgrace and the subsequent malaise that gripped America. Intent to prevent the NPP from steering America into uncertain waters, Bennett made the decision to throw his hat in the ring for the Presidency, hoping to keep the nation on track to a safe, stable and prosperous future.\n\nAlthough he may not have the charisma or big ideals of some of his opponents, Bennett's gambit paid off, the American public choosing a candidate who promised to hold the ship steady and put to rest their uncertainty for the future. Whether or not he will succeed remains to be seen, but it seems that the American public, like their new President, believe the old proverb: that slow and steady wins the race."

He has also laid out plans to strengthen America's position both within the OFN and beyond, with a myriad of economic and diplomatic programs aimed at uniting the planet's remaining bastions of democracy. There are some who argue that his policies are weak and that his compromises will ultimately leave nobody happy.

Eventually, the country will run out of bullion before it runs out of greenbacks. To rectify the looming crisis, President Bennett aims to decouple the dollar from silver in increments - using less silver in coinage, restricting dollar-to-silver conversion, etc. - and eventually reunite the country's currency with the much more plentiful gold.\n\nMankind may not want to be crucified upon a cross of gold, says a certain presidential candidate... but neither will it agree, surely, to be crucified had the cross been made of silver instead."

Compounding this issue is the fact that such laws differ from country to country; keeping track of them all without a universal standard stifles, and has stifled, trade beyond reason.\n\nTherefore, President Bennett, keen on reforming yet another facet of the largest alliance of democracies on Earth, plans on dismantling some of these barriers by proposing unified immigration and tariff standards for the OFN.

USA_wfb_64_token_reform:0 "Token Reform"
USA_wfb_64_token_reform_desc:0 "After some deliberation, President Bennett has decided that the best course of action is a modest program of reform. With some new laws to protect the worst injustices against our African American population, we can prove to them that we are listening. We might have to tick off the segregationists a little bit to achieve this, but as long as we toe the line and water down some of the more radical proposals, we can settle this issue without making too many people unhappy."

USA_wfb_64_codified_protections_desc:0 "While there have been efforts in the past to grant rights and liberties to African Americans, lawmakers have time and time again manipulated and creatively interpreted the law to deny them these rights. Our efforts should focus on modifying federal law to legally codify the rights, guarantees and protections granted to these American citizens in a clear, well-defined manner. By closing the legal loopholes used to keep them oppressed, we can ensure that racial minorities are granted the fundamental protections needed to bring them on level with the rest of America."

USA_wfb_64_crack_down_on_resistance_desc:0 "It's time to clear the streets. Protests and riots are still ongoing across the country, and if we are to ensure a civilized debate we must put an end to these constant battlegrounds. We will increase police funding, send them out to round up the worst trouble makers and order the rest of the people home. To avoid accusations of political favouritism, we will crack down on the violence on both sides. If either side wants to be listened to, they need to start acting like adults."
USA_wfb_64_voting_station_inspection:0 "Voting Station Inspections"
USA_wfb_64_voting_station_inspection_desc:0 "Voter suppression is a major issue that has been flagged by the civil rights activists. Minorities are often prevented from voting through a myriad of obscure regulations, a confusing registration process and a lack of non-English language materials. We should send out inspectors to certain problem areas to make sure everyone is being offered their democratic rights. This should also make us more popular amongst the civil rights movement without annoying the segregationists too much - after all, we're just enforcing rights people should already be entitled to."
USA_wfb_64_one_great_push:0 "One Great Push"
USA_wfb_64_one_great_push_desc:0 "President Bennett wants the civil rights debate settled as soon as possible. He has gathered the lawmakers together for a marathon session that aims to introduce a rapid fire sequence of laws to vote. He has hopes that if we can get the issue dealt with quickly, we can keep it out of the news cycle for a lengthy period and thus lessen the anger segregationists might feel towards us than if we were to allow the process to drag out. The time for idling is over - let's get this issue sorted once and for all."
USA_wfb_64_dont_rock_boat:0 "Don't Rock the Boat"
USA_wfb_64_dont_rock_boat_desc:0 "After some deliberation, President Bennett has decided that the best course of action is to pursue a cautious policy in dealing with the civil rights issue. The concerns of the segregationists cannot be ignored, and to force them to change their ways would be an act of tyranny. We can still offer some basic reforms that will give protections to minority communities, but they might be left wanting. Still, the segregationists do constitute a significant proportion of our voting base, and the needs of the party must be considered."
USA_wfb_64_check_committees:0 "Keep the Committees in Check"
USA_wfb_64_check_committees_desc:0 "Most Americans' experience with legislation as a process begins and ends at the Oval Office, where the President signs Congress-approved bills into law in front of cameras and key allies. What the memoirs and tabloids neglect to mention, perhaps because of their comparative lack of glamor if not scandal, is that these laws have to pass through a whole battery of committees and subcommittees before they even see the light of Capitol Hill. Astute observers would point out this facet of American lawmaking's mind-bogglingly byzantine nature... but for the Beltway's savvy participants, the tedium this presents is a beloved tool to keep the laws they dislike from ever seeing the light of Capitol Hill.\n\nPresident Bennett is aware of the many ways his opponents can utilize this fearsome bureaucratic bludgeon to undermine the passage of his own Civil Rights Act, and plans to make appeals of support to his fellow Republican-Democrats in the appropriate committees."
USA_wfb_64_rally_congress_votes:0 "Rally Congressional Votes"
USA_wfb_64_rally_congress_votes_desc:0 "If we are to resolve the civil rights matter, we must secure the support of Congress to pass the necessary legislation. Thanks to both the charisma of President Bennett and the party's balanced position on the matter, it may be possible to rally congressmen from the Republicans, the Center and the Far-Right all at once. This will require some deals to be cut with various factions and interest groups within Congress to get some of the more wavering folks on board, but as long as we promise to push a few of their personal causes forwards a bit it shouldn't be difficult to garner their votes. When we have their support, we will be ready to do what is necessary for the future of the nation."

USA_wfb_64_right_to_free_speech_desc:0 "Freedom of speech is a core pillar of American society. To deny it to anyone, no matter their opinion, is a gross breach of the vision our Founding Fathers had for this country. Both the segregationists and the civil rights activists call each other's words 'reprehensible,' 'disgusting' and 'un-American,' but the truth is that we must allow them both to have a say. We may not like what they have to say, but we shall defend to the death their right to say it - no matter who 'they' are or 'what they have to say' is."
USA_wfb_64_keep_it_vague:0 "Keep it Vague"

We shall assure them that they are important to us and that we are willing to do what needs to be done. Eventually. We will promise them things, that we will deliver at some point, as-so-when-there-to-for the opportune opportunity arises. What are those things? When will they be delivered? Don't worry, the government knows what it's doing. The people should not worry themselves, they must understand that we are doing what we can. When we can do it. If we can do it. Maybe."
USA_wfb_64_state_inspections:0 "State Inspections"
USA_wfb_64_state_inspections_desc:0 "The southern states are extremely opposed to any federal oversight in their election process. While it's true that there are aspects of their infrastructure and legislation that are rather unfair to minority communities, we cannot risk looking like federal tyrants and giving more legitimacy to the Far-Right NPP. What we can do is simply encourage the states themselves to examine their own systems, and form investigations on the state level to root out discriminatory practices. Many will argue that this will lead to inevitable bias on the part of the states and nothing will actually change. On the other hand, if any true change is to happen, it must come from below as well as from above."
USA_wfb_64_step_by_step:0 "Step by Step, Bit by Bit"
USA_wfb_64_step_by_step_desc:0 "It is as the old saying goes - 'slow and steady wins the race.' History has shown us that the most successful changes don't happen overnight, but take steady reform over many years to take their desired effect. We can make some progress to make the civil rights people happy while still keeping the segregationists on side. Rather than introducing reforms all at once, we will implement them gradually - this way, conservatives are not shocked by a rapid paradigm shift in our culture, and progressives can rest assured that change is coming, albeit slowly."
USA_wfb_64_acceptable_solution:0 "An Acceptable Solution"
USA_wfb_64_acceptable_solution_desc:0 "It has taken a lot of careful balancing, but we have devised a strategy which might be palatable to both sides of the civil rights issue. We've taken on board criticism and concerns from both sides of the debate - we may have leaned slightly one way or the other, but it matters not. The point is, we have several bills lined up that should hopefully get most of America on the same page. This includes a range of civil rights legislation that has taken on board both the desires of the civil rights movement as well as the concerns of the segregationists. We can prove that the art of compromise is key in solving America's issues."
USA_wfb_64_voices_of_people:0 "The Voices of the People"
USA_wfb_64_voices_of_people_desc:0 "We can argue about the specifics of what civil rights actually mean all day, but nobody understands what they mean better than those directly affected. All across the country, millions of African Americans and other minorities languish, disenfranchised from the political system. Many of them simply do not bother to engage in politics as a result. If we are to unite America, we should reach out to their communities and get them directly involved in both local and national politics. We can make their voices heard, and allow them to join the conversation."
USA_wfb_64_leave_to_experts:0 "Leave it to the Experts"
USA_wfb_64_leave_to_experts_desc:0 "State governors and other local politicians are far more suited to deciding policy on the matter of civil rights than federal politicians in Washington. While we can still encourage them to take a more progressive tone on the issue, they should ultimately have the final say on what exact reforms take place. After all, they were voted for by the people of their respective states, so they are clearly qualified to make the important decisions on what is best for their local communities."
USA_wfb_64_subcommittees_subcommittees:0 "Subcommittees upon Subcommittees"
USA_wfb_64_subcommittees_subcommittees_desc:0 "American history is replete with instances where laws are applied such that they are not applied at all, yet seem to be applied if observed at a glance. One need look no further than the Reconstruction-era amendments for glaring examples of such -- and painfully relevant ones at that, considering what the President is planning to add to the long and hefty list thereof.\n\nAfter consulting with his advisors and party members in Congress, he has accepted that pursuing civil rights any further will invite more paralysis than the American political system can afford. Capital and goodwill wasted on exchanging old allies for new and controversial stances is capital and goodwill not spent on curtailing America's rampant inflation, or on containing fascism's metastasis in the world's last unblemished patches.\n\nBut neither can he afford to be seen by the public as ignoring the issue wholesale. With this in mind, he turns to the Congressman's second truest friend next to the filibuster: Red tape. If you want the right thing done after trying everything else, to modify a saying..."
USA_wfb_64_leave_door_open:0 "Leave the Door Open"
USA_wfb_64_leave_door_open_desc:0 "While we have taken a more conservative path on the issue of civil rights than the activists might like, there is no reason why we cannot have more change in the future. As President Bennett has insisted in the past, real change does not happen overnight. Though the government needs to get on to other things, we can keep the discussion going, and encourage those who believe in the cause of civil rights to direct their efforts towards future reforms. This way, we can keep the civil rights movement reasonably content and also prevent the segregationists from feeling alienated."
USA_wfb_64_lock_and_key:0 "Under Lock and Key"
USA_wfb_64_lock_and_key_desc:0 "We should make it clear that, for the foreseeable future at least, the issue of civil rights is settled. We have already devoted far too much time to the issue, and it is time we get on to other more pressing matters of government. The civil rights movement will probably be somewhat upset, but they should at least acknowledge that they are in a better position than they were before. Putting our foot down should also reassure the Dixiecrats that we aren't abandoning them or our own values."
USA_wfb_64_empower_democrats:0 "Empower the Democrats"
USA_wfb_64_empower_democrats_desc:0 "With government policy taking a distinctly conservative turn, President Bennett is now presented with a unique opportunity. Many people are finding their faith in the Democrats - once utterly shattered after the loss of the war - suddenly revived. We have the chance to present ourselves as the new face of the status quo, and finally restore our party to dominance in the American political theatre. We will always be grateful to our Republican partners for ensuring our survival these past two decades, of course. But now it is time for us to return to our place in the sun."
USA_wfb_64_clarify_terms:0 "Clarify Certain Terms"
USA_wfb_64_clarify_terms_desc:0 "The acts we have passed so far, on top of a myriad of other regulations and laws established by previous governments, has left the legislation on the matter of civil rights a confusing mess. This ambiguity has left both segregationists and civil rights activists uncertain of where exactly they stand. Now that we have put the foot down on any further legislation, we should focus our efforts on clarifying the laws that already exist, ensuring all terms are clearly defined and that there is no more room for 'creative interpretations'. All Americans must be able to clearly understand the laws they live under."

USA_wfb_64_sideline_republicans_desc:0 "Some of our Republican partners are reportedly distraught at the path our government is taking, feeling that their liberal values are being ignored. We should gently remind them that it was the corruption and abject failure of the previous Republican-dominated administration that saw them swept from power, and saw us swept into it. They should understand that the people do not want them anymore, so they should step back and let us give America the leadership it deserves. Perhaps, one day, we shall have a Democratic-Republican Party once again..."
USA_wfb_64_through_guidance_stability:0 "Through Guidance, Stability"
USA_wfb_64_through_guidance_stability_desc:0 "President Bennett has proven that the Democrats can take the lead in national politics through their calm, conservative manner of governance. While many may clamor for true progress, it is in the interests of all that the stability of the nation be considered first and foremost. The fires of progress must be kept controlled by the guiding hand of tradition, lest the fire set our society aflame. To the good people of the civil rights movement; we know you are not satisfied, but you must be patient, for our society is not quite ready to accept your view just yet. Your time will come, but for the time being, we must keep America steady as she goes."

USA_wfb_64_listen_to_stories_desc:0 "It is a sad reality that segregationists view African Americans as less than people, a concept they have been taught all their lives. While it is unlikely we could convince the most staunch racists of the error of their ways, we could still change the minds of some of the more moderate people. We should encourage the civil rights supporters, especially the African Americans themselves, to speak up about their experiences and how segregation has affected them. By giving them a voice to speak directly to the segregationists, we might be able to change some minds and get most people on board with the reforms we need."
USA_wfb_64_take_the_floor:0 "Take the Floor"
USA_wfb_64_take_the_floor_desc:0 "With our policy direction mostly decided upon, it is time for us to convince the party to support our policy. While we are unlikely to change the minds of those staunchly against us, we can still win over those wavering in the middle who remain ambivalent. By taking the lead in the debates on the Senate floor, we can gain the necessary support we need to see our course through to its conclusion. All we need to do to get people on our side is talk to them."
USA_wfb_64_symbols_of_progress:0 "Symbols of Progress"
USA_wfb_64_symbols_of_progress_desc:0 "We have made significant concessions to the civil rights movement and made efforts to engage minority communities. However, our conservative voter base is beginning to voice unease, feeling that we are beginning to turn away from them. We have done much good, but it is time to put the civil rights issue to bed. We have done more than enough to benefit people, and if we stop now we can avoid upsetting the segregationists any more than they already are."
USA_wfb_64_fine_line:0 "A Fine Line"
USA_wfb_64_fine_line_desc:0 "Our careful balance of both liberal and conservative values has earned us at least muted approval from both sides of the spectrum. True to his word, President Bennett has gone to great lengths to bring all of America under one banner, favoring neither side above the other, while ensuring everyone walks away reasonably happy. Nobody can say they got everything they wanted, but that is the nature of compromise. With our government policy taking a reasonable middle ground, it is highly likely that for the most part, the status quo will be maintained within the halls of power."
USA_wfb_64_real_change:0 "Real Change"
USA_wfb_64_real_change_desc:0 "Though the Democrats are traditionally a party of conservative values, President Bennett and many senior members of the party have been swayed by the arguments of the civil rights movement. We can no longer beat around the bush - in this case, America needs progress if we truly want to be a government for all Americans. While we won't take things as far as some of the other parties are suggesting, we will provide real reform that will guarantee the political rights of African Americans nationwide. The segregationists will not be happy, but we can no longer deny that the current system is unfair and deeply flawed."
USA_wfb_64_empower_republicans:0 "Empower the Republicans"
USA_wfb_64_empower_republicans_desc:0 "Our turn towards more liberal politics has greatly pleased our Republican partners, who are glad we have managed to bring forward progress on the civil rights issue without burning the country down. Our change in direction has confused and outraged some people, however, with many questioning why the Democratic half of the RDs are even necessary if both factions are following the same line of thinking. While this may be damaging for us, President Bennett believes that in this case, we must throw our support behind the policies of the Republican party to make the system work for all Americans."
USA_wfb_64_perfectly_broken:0 "A Perfectly Broken System"
USA_wfb_64_perfectly_broken_desc:0 "In the past, some have called the union of the Democratic and the Republican party a Frankenstein, an abomination - a traditionally liberal and traditionally conservative party joined at the hip, a coalition too broad and diametrically opposed to work. As President Bennett proves, a consideration of the values of both parties is actually far more beneficial to our nation than simply considering each set of values in isolation. Besides, we've made broad-spectrum politics work far better than the NPP and their constant bickering amongst themselves. In all, the Bennett presidency has made the bond between the Republican-Democrats stronger than ever; even if we have our ups and downs with each other, we have shown we can work together for the betterment of all."
USA_wfb_64_through_fellowship_unity:0 "Through Fellowship, Unity"
USA_wfb_64_through_fellowship_unity_desc:0 "The one thing President Bennett has not compromised on is his willingness to compromise. Never once doubting that meaningful change can be achieved while still respecting those who value tradition, he has ensured that all aspects of our society are represented, proving himself the true master of compromise. There is always more room for changes and alterations in the future, but with all parties reasonably satisfied, we can save those future discussions for another day. Segregationists, civil rights activists, people and politicians - we are all Americans, and now we can step forwards to face the issues of the day together."
USA_wfb_64_sideline_democrats:0 "Sideline the Democrats"
USA_wfb_64_sideline_democrats_desc:0 "In the interests of pursuing what is right for America, we must unfortunately concede that we have lost a lot of support with our conservative voting base. Segregationists accuse us of selling out to the civil rights movement, and recent polls suggest that we will lose a significant number of votes in the next election as a result of our shift away from traditional conservatism. Though progressives have come to respect us for our acceptance of their concerns, most are likely to continue voting for either the Republicans or the Center-NPP, parties more recognizably aligned with their values. Some call our new course political suicide. Maybe it is. But at least at the end of the day, we can say we put the needs of the country over the needs of the party."
USA_wfb_64_voting_rights_act:0 "A Voting Rights Act"
USA_wfb_64_voting_rights_act_desc:0 "Lyndon B. Johnson, senate leader for the Republicans, has taken the floor with the support of various figures from his party faction to propose a Voting Rights Act. This act would go a step further than the protections we have implemented thus far, and guarantee the political and voting rights of African Americans and other minorities on the federal level. With progressive values beginning to win out across both the Republicans and the Democrats, it would make little sense to oppose this new bill, which would cement our support with the civil rights movement. However, many within our party fear this would be seen as a grave transgression by the segregationists, and that we will likely lose a lot of support in the south for allowing this to go through."
USA_wfb_64_through_change_progress:0 "Through Change, Progress"
USA_wfb_64_through_change_progress_desc:0 "We are conservatives; that much has not changed, but to fail to let other ideas be heard and take root when the nation so clearly needs them is the height of bullheadedness. We understand that our traditional voters may not agree, but it is our duty to represent all Americans, not just those who tick our box at the polls. By guaranteeing true unalienable rights for everyone, we ensure that the nation can truly work together as one entity. To the segregationists; we understand we have disappointed you, but know that we will continue to represent you in all other aspects. Even the seasons change, and for the sake of our country, so too must America."

USA_wfb_64_for_all_the_struggle_desc:0 "For over a decade, the issue of civil rights has hung over America like a looming storm cloud, bringing discord and upheaval in its wake. Nary a year ago streets all across our nation echoed with the yells of progressives and segregationists crying fury in each other's faces, seeing each other not as fellow Americans but as enemies. The issue threatened to tear apart the very fabric of America. Now, the streets are mostly quiet. Those once bellicose protesters and furious statesmen have either celebrated the dawn of a new day, or accepted that the world has moved past their squabbles. Even if some are still upset, President Bennett has successfully secured the continued stability of American society."
USA_wfb_64_we_are_stronger:0 "We are All the Stronger"
USA_wfb_64_we_are_stronger_desc:0 "We can call the issue of civil rights resolved, at least for now. Any further legislation on the matter can be handled in a calm, rational manner over time, as our great political system always allowed for. With the main source of consternation in our nation quelled, we can finally present ourselves as a strong, united force against all the darkness of the world. Unlike in Japan or Germany, we Americans handle our issues with dignity, lawfulness and common ground, not jackboots and suppression. By setting this example for not only our country, but for all the remaining free nations of the world, we can let humanity know that democracy is still kicking!"
USA_wfb_64_torch_burns_bright:0 "The Torch Burns Bright"
USA_wfb_64_torch_burns_bright_desc:0 "In his wisdom, President Jefferson once said that the tree of liberty must be watered every so often by the blood of patriots. President Bennett was not one for violence -- but he does believe that the torch of human freedom must likewise be fed with kindling and tinder. The intensity of its flames proportions itself accordingly to the quality of its tendered fuel; stronger commitments to like-minded causes create brighter, more beautiful flames.\n\nEight years of hindsight has led the President to appreciate how far it has grown: Once sputtered licks of ember after Watergate, now a blazing inferno after the many reforms of his two terms. At home, the American people now exercise their freedoms under a safe and stable system managed by capable men. Abroad, America's own league of free nations grow by leaps and bounds, bringing life and vigor to ideals besieged by fascist empires..."

Systems are wont to be upended by their own weight in time, and a large enough crisis can knock one over to make room for another, better suited to tackle the present and its issues than the past's. But the weary Utahn allowed himself some satisfaction for making the most out of his Presidency, and thus in bringing about the feats his country can achieve at its greatest.\n\nWallace F. Bennett let out a chuckle as he leaned back against the most prestigious office chair in Washington, D.C. His feet laid atop the Resolute Desk, legs now free to shuffle about a desk void of drafts and memos for the first time in eight years. America can fight its causes without him... but with him, he can deservedly say, it has gained the disposition and the means to fight on for many decades yet.\n\nNot bad for a Mormon office clerk, all things considered."

WFB.2.t:0 "Appointment of Edmund Muskie"
WFB.2.desc:0 "If one were to think of an ideal candidate for Secretary of State, Edmund Muskie... wouldn't be it. He's reserved, blunt, and relatively inexperienced in foreign affairs. But with all that said, Muskie has a lot going for him. If Treasury Secretary Robertson is a reward to President Bennett's conservative backers, Secretary of State Muskie is an olive branch to the liberal wing of the Republican-Democrats. As Maine's governor, and, subsequently, senator, he's championed civil rights and environmental protections, bringing Maine fully into the 20th century. Depending on who you ask, he's either the right man to represent America on the world stage, or a lily-livered provincial who's better off sending pork back to Portland. As one editor wryly put it: "Sending Muskie against the Germans would be like sending a three-toed sloth out to seize turf from a wolverine."\n\n"
WFB.2.a:0 "I guess we'll just have to see."

WFB.3.t:0 "Appointment of Absalom Robertson"
WFB.3.desc:0 ""Absalom, Absalom!" reads more than one witty editorial headline. With the nomination of Absalom Robertson to the post of Treasury Secretary, the reference to Dixie literature is adroit, but Robertson himself is a serious man. A scion of Virginia's powerful Byrd Organization, Robertson belongs firmly in the camp of conservative Southern Democrats, adamantly opposed to any sort of integration. His appointment is surely a sop to President Bennett's supporters in Congress. But it also has many in the opposition worried. The Treasury Department has a great deal of power over taxes and audits. What might it do to those who come out against Bennett's agenda, especially with an arch-conservative in the driver's seat? And then there's that new production company that his son, Pat, is setting up...\n\n"

WFB.4.t:0 "Appointment of Robert McNamara"
WFB.4.desc:0 "It would be unfair to call Robert Strange McNamara a man of numbers, and numbers alone. Sure, he made his name as Harvard's youngest professor, and helped save Ford from its postwar fiscal chaos. But McNamara has his fair share of ideology. In contrast to those who call for the razing of Japan or German Africa, he wants the Pentagon to take a more measured approach. Fewer first-strike capabilities, and more deterrence. Fewer rigid doctrines, and more counterinsurgency. To his supporters in Congress, McNamara is a man who will shake things up, rationalizing the business of war in a new era of conflict. The question remains, though: will he truly change the Pentagon, or will his efforts get bogged down in the old system?\n\n"

WFB.51.t:0 "Stopgap Measures"
WFB.51.desc:0 "With silver reserves at all-time lows, the metallic backing system that supports America's currency is in crisis. While the Bennett White House begins to push their legislative reform plan, Treasury Secretary Robertson has already directed the U.S. Mint to take a variety of stopgap measures. By halting the production of a number of denominations, the hope is that the decline in silver reserves will begin to stabilize. After all, we can't afford to be profligate at times like this!\n\n"

First, he had been shown some of the hard-working men and women (well, one woman, anyway) who designed anti-counterfeiting markers. His bureaucrat guides then showed off the vast quantities of ink, paper, and machinery that, when combined, created one of the world's most important currencies. One of the guides brought out a new five-dollar bill, and offered it to Robertson. He obligingly held it up for the UPI cameraman, smiling as the paper Abe Lincoln grimaced.\n\n"

WFB.54.t:0 "Passage of the Silver Purchase Act of [GetYear]"
WFB.54.desc:0 "Today, the Silver Act passed both houses of Congress with moderate fanfare. In spite of some reservations about the economic impact of the act, it passed with a significant majority. This act has mostly been a part of a larger move away from silver as a currency-backing metal in favor of other options, notably gold.\n\nMore a removal of past legislation than anything, the act includes multiple provisions geared toward a decrease in silver backing. The most major among these directives is the repeal of the 1934 Silver Purchase Act, which effectively subsidized and encouraged silver mining to unnatural levels. The act also allowed for the production of $1 and $2 Federal Reserve notes to keep up with a changing economy.\n\nLawmakers hope the act will prove successful. The repeal of the Silver Purchase Act will prevent rampant overspending on silver by the Treasury, and hopefully increase fiscal responsibility in general. Concerns over the passage have been minimal, and many are greatly relieved by the move toward a more simplified and robust currency."

WFB.59.desc:0 "Vancouver (AP): After months of negotiations spanning multiple continents, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was signed by representatives of more than twenty countries. The so-called Vancouver Round, which was intended to finalize a number of concessions, led to the repeal of numerous tariffs and trade regulations by countries in the Organization of Free Nations, as well as a number of neutral states. Secretary of State Edmund Muskie, who was present at the signing, hailed the GATT. At the ceremony, he stated: "This agreement will not just encourage trade among free peoples. It will also encourage liberty around the world. From American factories to Australian ports, and from Canadian mines to Argentine farms, the world can find prosperity through peace and fair exchange. By repealing tariffs, that idea of fairness will become the norm."\n\n"

Countless martinis had been imbibed, more than one ankle had been sprained on the slopes, and a torrid affair between Guyanese staffers had ended in tears.

The effects of the agreement will be far-reaching to all members of the alliance. With the creation of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Group, the international lending of reserve currency is now a possibility. Among other stipulations, this essentially ties the economies of all members to the United States and greatly simplifies international exchange.\n\nMany diplomats have championed the system as a promising sign of greater international cooperation within the alliance, citing the ability of every OFN nation to draw from the might of the U.S. economy with little difficulty should any local crises arise.

The Democratic wing of the coalition has sided with pro-segregation southern states, citing states' rights as an argument to allow for the preservation of the system. This has led to intense conflict with the Republican wing, which sees the enforcement of civil rights as necessary to securing freedom for all Americans. Still others have taken a middle-of-the-road stance and advocated for compromise wherever possible to prevent the complete separation of both parties.\n\nDepending on the route we take for this issue, there can and will be severe consequences to the unity of the party. Regardless of the outcome, far-right and far-left factions of the National Progressive Party will inevitably use the ordeal as a power play to gain votes from disillusioned politicians.

Bennett came to an amicable agreement, with the Dixiecrats making great concessions to the R-D's and their Civil Rights bill. President Bennett stated to reporters, "This is a fine day for democracy, and for the people of the United States. I am overjoyed that a good agreement was reached with Senator Thurmond and his voting bloc."\n\nIn the coming weeks, the amended Civil Rights bill is expected to sweep both houses of Congress without much issue. Some of the more hardline Dixiecrats are up in arms over the unexpected amount of concessions that were made, but overall, both parties came out of the Columbia Conference in high spirits."

WFB.108.t:0 "Okay Compromise"
WFB.108.desc:0 "Today, in an unsurprising turn of events, Strom Thurmond and President Wallace F. Bennett came to a rough and grudging agreement, with the Dixiecrats only willing to make minor concessions to the R-D's and their Civil Rights bill. More than half of the Dixiecrats at the Columbia Conference simply walked out, refusing to concede at all. President Bennett stated to reporters, "This is a fine day for democracy, and for the people of the United States. I am overjoyed that an agreement was reached that will allow the bill to go forward."\n\nTo the dismay of many, the new Civil Rights bill is far weaker than before, as the R-D's made sacrifices to gain the paltry support of only a few Southerners. In the coming weeks, the greatly amended bill is expected to barely struggle through Congress, with just enough votes to be passed. Overall, the new bill is proving to be a very divisive issue, with both parties coming out of the affair somewhat displeased."

WFB.109.t:0 "Columbia Conference Fails!"
WFB.109.desc:0 "America is gripped by uncertainty, as news from Columbia spreads across the nation like a shadow; the Columbia Conference has failed. Over the past week, politicians from across the nation debated in the South Carolina State House over compromises on President Wallace F. Bennett's Civil Rights bill. Unfortunately, the Dixiecrats could not come to terms with the R-D's and the President, and thus, the bill has not been amended and is unlikely to receive the required votes to be passed into law.\n\nPresident Bennett, leaving the Columbia Conference, said that he was disappointed that agreement could not be found, but was confident that the bill would pass regardless.\n\nThe failure of the Columbia Conference has come as a shock to some, and an unfortunate inevitability to others. The future of President Bennett's Civil Rights bill is now in question, and with it, America's future."
WFB.109.a:0 "What will Bennett do now?"

WFB.110.t:0 "Dixiecrats Refuse Compromise!"
WFB.110.desc:0 "After President Bennett's speech in Washington, D.C., in which he publicly requested to meet with Dixiecrat leaders to hammer out a compromise, many expected the Dixiecrats to at least make a show of being cooperative. Unfortunately, it appears their stubborn nature knows no bounds, as Strom Thurmond, with his voting caucus firmly behind him, have unequivocally refused to meet with the President. "No Civil Rights," said Senator Thurmond, "not today, nor tomorrow, nor in a century."\n\nAs the country once again holds its breath over the incredibly divisive upcoming vote on the bill, President Bennett has yet to comment on this unfortunate turn of events. Rather than create a more tense situation by berating the Dixiecrats, the President seems content to hold his breath and seek greener pastures."
WFB.110.a:0 "Let's hope that he can pull it off without them."

WFB.111.t:0 "New Allies"
WFB.111.desc:0 "As the Dixiecrats refused to cooperate, President Bennett has been forced to find another way to pass his Civil Rights bill. Currently, the President and his R-D allies are looking for friends among the left and center leaning NPP congressmen. In addition, some of the fence-sitting Democrats in the R-D's are likely candidates for recruitment into Bennett's new voting group. Today, President Bennett and Senator Lyndon Johnson are meeting with several members of these groups, most notably the C-NPP's [GetRFKOrJackson], attempting to swing them over to the side of Civil Rights. As of right now, however, these alliances are just beginning to take shape, and whether or not they will actually be able to pass the bill remains to be seen. With the day Congress votes on the bill growing closer, one wonders if the President will be able to form these alliances in time."
WFB.111.a:0 "Who needs the Dixiecrats anyway?"

WFB.112.t:0 "Alliances to Ashes"
WFB.112.desc:0 "After meeting with several influential C-NPP congressmen, as well as a few Democrats, President Bennett and his pro-Civil Rights Caucus have come up empty handed. While somewhat expected, considering the rushed nature of the alliances in question, it is still another setback for the President. With no potential new proponents of his bill, Bennett is left in an awkward position; he must put forth a bill he knows will fail.\n\nPresident Bennett has yet to comment on these failed compromises and failed alliances, only responding that "We'll get the bill passed, don't you worry about that.""
WFB.112.a:0 "Will he now?"


WFB.113.t:0 "New Friends in Old Places"
WFB.113.desc:0 "Everything is complete: the alliances have been made. After some debate and deliberation, the majority of the C-NPP and R-D fence sitters have joined the voting caucus for President Bennett's Civil Rights bill. Assuming everything goes to plan, the bill should be able to sweep both the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, it was no simple matter to convince some left-leaning members of the C-NPP to vote for the bill. Influential figures in the party, such as Michael Harrington, found the bill fell short of true social equality, and believed that, were it passed, there would be no more political will for further Civil Rights legislation. On the opposite end of the spectrum, many fence-sitting, old-fashioned Democrats feared that the bill was perhaps too ambitious. Balancing these two groups proved to be an immense challenge; the bill would not pass without their support. Despite some setbacks, the President and Senator Lyndon Johnson were able to convince them to throw their lot in with the bill.\n\nNo official announcement regarding the alliance has been made, and likely never will. Word spreads fast of changing loyalties, however, and the lips of politics are the loosest in existence. No doubt Strom Thurmond and his Dixiecrat caucus already know of the success of Bennett's gamble, and it no doubt terrifies them."
WFB.113.a:0 "So much for working with Thurmond..."

WFB.114.t:0 "The Comprehensive Civil Rights Bill Passed!"
WFB.114.desc:0 "Today, in a surprising announcement, President Bennett's liberal Civil Rights bill has been passed, with possibly the most significant legal protection for non-whites since the passing of the 15th Amendment in 1870. It includes comprehensive protections for voting rights, forbidding state-mandated "literacy tests" targeted at African Americans. It also includes timetables for the total desegregation of American society, demanding that all Jim Crow laws and other race-based legislation be repealed within four months. Most importantly, however, it forbids the discrimination of employment on race, color, religion, or national origin.\n\nMany are surprised that such an all-encompassing, liberal Civil Rights bill was even passed in the first place. In the weeks leading up to the voting on the bill, there was quite a scramble in the R-D's, as President Bennett and his allies struggled to gather the votes. In the end, however, it appears the President was able to get the bill passed, with no compromises on the rights and freedoms of minorities."
WFB.114.a:0 "Impressive."

WFB.115.t:0 "The Moderate Civil Rights Bill Passed!"
WFB.115.desc:0 "Today, President Wallace F. Bennett's Civil Rights bill successfully achieved a majority of votes in both the House and the Senate, with the President soon to sign it into law. The bill, while less comprehensive than some might have hoped, is still one of the largest steps towards total equality between Americans since the passing of the 15th Amendment in 1870. The bill includes federal protections for voting rights, prohibiting "literacy tests" and other such fraudulent measures at the state level intended to disenfranchise minorities from voting. It also includes the prohibition of discriminatory employment based on race, color, religion, etc.\n\nMany more liberal-minded citizens are dissatisfied with how the bill has turned out, however. The bill was originally much more liberal and comprehensive, with far greater protection of the rights of minorities. Due to the need to compromise with Conservative politicians in Washington, several of these protections were loosened or simply removed entirely. Despite this, the majority of people across the nation are simply pleased that any Civil Rights legislation was passed at all."
WFB.115.a:0 "Not quite as good as was hoped for, but still good."

WFB.116.t:0 "The Conservative Civil Rights Bill Passed!"
WFB.116.desc:0 "After months of deliberation, compromise, and voting, President Wallace F. Bennett's Civil Rights bill has finally been passed by both houses of Congress and is likely to be signed into law in the coming weeks. The once highly liberal Civil Rights Act has now been effectively neutered by the more conservative elements in Washington. All provisions for voting protection against minority disenfranchisement have been removed, and only moderate prohibition of discriminatory employment practices. In addition, greatly encompassing exceptions have been added to the bill, dictating that in certain circumstances, minority protections need not be enforced.\n\nOverall, the bill has drawn a vast amount of criticism from the more liberal-minded politicians in Washington, with many deeming it ineffectual. While conservatives across the country are pleased with the outcome, Bennett's Civil Rights legislation is quickly proving unpopular with the general public."
WFB.116.a:0 "Disappointing, though not unexpected."

WFB.117.t:0 "Dixiecrats Pleased"
WFB.117.desc:0 "After President Bennett's recent passing of an unexpectedly conservative Civil Rights bill, the Dixiecrats are unsurprisingly pleased. In a recent televised statement, Strom Thurmond, Senator from South Carolina and avid Civil Rights opponent, expressed his "gratitude" that "clear heads prevailed in the Capitol."\n\nOverall, however, this is simply a bad look for the President and the R-D's. The overt support of the Dixiecrats means the Civil Rights bill appears less genuine to the public, and thus Bennett appears less concerned with the people, and more with getting what he wants.\n\nIn a recent press conference, when questioned over this turn of events and whether or not his administration is becoming more conservative, the President had this to say:\n\n"I am still the man I am when I took office. My opinions are my own and have not changed. The Southern voting caucus being pleased with my actions is not a consequence of changing allegiance on my part. Rather, it is a consequence of certain agreements between us, which, I assure you, have always existed.""

WFB.118.t:0 "Liberals Wary"
WFB.118.desc:0 "In recent weeks, following President Wallace F. Bennett's passing of a surprisingly conservative Civil Rights bill, the liberals in Congress, represented by the Republicans and some of the C-NPP, have found themselves in an uncomfortable spot. Many voters back in their home states, who elected them for liberal policies, are quite dissatisfied with their acceptance and support of such a conservative piece of legislation. Consequently, should even more conservative action be taken in the future, the Liberals face a serious threat of losing re-election.\n\nUnderstandably, many liberal congressmen are afraid that they may be replaced. In response, they have begun to rally and take a larger role in legislating. In addition, they are quite upset with President Bennett for threatening the fabric of the R-D's as a whole. Should they be faced with voting for another conservative bill, it is unlikely that they will follow the President's lead, instead doing everything in their power to halt its passing."

Investigations by the FBI and other agencies have determined that these claims are false and that no violations of the 15th Amendment have occurred.\n\nAlready, these investigations have drawn massive criticism from liberal and progressive elements across the country. The groups claim that these inquiries are fraudulent, corrupt, or insufficient. As far as the federal government is concerned, however, these claims are unsubstantiated, and no legislation prohibiting state-level voting regulations is likely to be passed."

Already, mere weeks after the conclusion of the inquiries, groups in the L-NPP and C-NPP are demanding that new investigators and investigations be brought in.\n\nMichael Harrington, a political leader of the C-NPP, has called the Southern voting process "despicable, discriminatory, and undemocratic," and demanded new federal inquiries. President Bennett, along with a large chunk of the Republican-Democratic Party, are dismissing all claims of corruption or another manner of manipulation, and no plans for new investigations are being made."

Despite this, many still believe our Southern brothers to be liars; that they are corrupt and dishonest to our government."\n\n"These accusations tear at the fabric of our nation. They tear away at the core of our national fraternity and weaken us as a whole. If our great land is to follow her trend of unending progress, I say that these false allegations must first be overcome.

WFB.122.desc:0 "In the past few weeks, following President Bennett's National Brotherhood speech, the left of the National Progressive Party and other progressives in Congress took a more positive stance on the conservative civil rights bill. Today, Senator [GetRFKOrJackson] met with Bennett at the White House, planning to come to terms with the rightist shift in national policy. This lukewarm approval was also communicated by Senator Lyndon Baines Johnson, leader of the Republicans, who said that his party will continue to work with the Democrats in their coalition. Overall, this has had a positive effect on the prospective bill, and things are looking up for Bennett and the R-D's in their pursuit of Civil Rights.\n\nThis turn of events was rather unexpected by many third-party observers, as the President's speech, while well worded, did nothing to alleviate the complaints and fears of the Progressives in Congress regarding the Civil Rights bill. This may hint that Kennedy and his voting bloc are less united than previously understood. In any case, they are now behind the bill, if only just. Now, all that is left is the vote: one to decide the future of America."

WFB.123.desc:0 "Following President Wallace F. Bennett's National Brotherhood speech, many expected congressional progressives to fold and get behind the President's conservative Civil Rights bill. However, the left has refused to relent on civil rights, denying the Democrats and the rightist faction of the National Progressive Party the votes needed to pass the bill. The President continues to call for the progressives to 'restore national brotherhood' and 'follow a path that is acceptable to all Americans.'\n\nSenator [GetRFKOrJackson], leader of the NPP's social democrats, says that his camp is standing firm. Almost all of the C-NPP has turned down Bennett's call for 'unity'. Senator Lyndon Baines Johnson, arguably the most influential Republican in congress, followed Kennedy's lead, stating that the bill was an "afront to foundations of the Republican-Democrat coalition". Rallying behind Kennedy and Johnson, many progressives believe that the bill will simply dampen support for Civil Rights legislation among the general public, while doing the bare minimum in actually achieving racial equality. Without their help, the R-D's will likely be forced to return to the drawing board to create legislation that the progressives find more amicable."

WFB.124.t:0 "Our Way or the Highway"
WFB.124.desc:0 "Since [GetRFKOrJackson] and his C-NPP caucus decided not to support President Bennett's conservative Civil Rights bill, the R-D's have been in a frenzy to gather the required votes to pass it. The party's Senate and House whips have been working around the clock to bully, bribe, or otherwise coerce fence-sitters into throwing in their hat with Bennett's Civil Rights bill. As of this moment, the votes are close, and it appears that when voting day comes, a select few congressmen will decide the bill's future.\n\nShould the R-D's fail to gather sufficient support, it is likely that they will be forced to cancel the vote and re-draft the bill to be more left-leaning. If this occurs, it is possible that they will be caught in a catch-22; if they change the bill to be more liberal, they will lose conservatives, but if they don't, they'll lose the progressives."

While no transcript of the meeting has been released, it is more than likely that its purpose was to discuss possible progressive support for the Civil Rights bill.\n\nAlready suspecting that their compromises with the R-D's will be violated in favor of the progressives, the conservatives advocating the bill are beginning to withdraw their support. It seems that the President has caught himself in a tight spot, in which he cannot pass the bill without the support of both groups, but will lose the support of one by compromising with the other.\n\nIn the coming weeks, the bill is likely to be re-drafted in a much more progressive fashion than before. Only time will tell if this new draft will succeed."

In particular, they complain about one of the bill's central clauses: that states cannot administer tests to determine voter eligibility. This clause was specifically targeted at southern states who administered 'literacy' tests that were nigh-impossible to pass for African-Americans, voiding their right to vote.\n\nObviously, these state-sponsored tests were in violation of the 15th Amendment, and thus illegal under federal law. Despite this, the Dixiecrats under Strom Thurmond believe that the tests were fair, simple, and non-discriminatory. The tests are now illegal, but the Dixiecrats will whine and complain until history passes them by."

"Good evening to those attending tonight's event, as well as any who may be watching from across our country. Tonight, I stand alongside my fellow Democrats to turn yet another page in the whirling twists and turns of the history of the United States. For centuries, many regarded African-Americans as commodities to be used and traded, even igniting a conflict which tore our nation asunder."\n\nIt seemed as if the air had been sucked out from the hall. Was the President about to defend the segregationists, or punch them in the gut? "Regretfully, we continue to witness injustices, with African-Americans suffering social, political, and economic wrongs at every level of society. While my fellow Democrats and I adhere to tradition and conservatism, this is by no means justification, or approval of, the prejudices faced by African-American citizens today. It is shameful that some continue to stand against the average American based on the color of their skin. The administration will work to end these wrongs, once and for all.""

I understand that you've come to hold yourself in a high regard ever since you ascended to the Presidency; however, the facts remain. Now, President Bennett, I happen to consider myself what you'd like to call a 'Southern gentleman,' and it is in that regard that I am, quite frankly, disgusted that you have left our traditions and wills out of the enforcement of the law in this here country. How on Earth would you want me to work with you when you're spitting on all of our customs, Mr. President?"\n\n"Well, you see, Senator Barnett, my administration is working towards a solution that will best fit the needs of all those in the country, and settle this issue for once and for all.

Ford said, as his arms laid cross against his chest, while looking down.\n\n"You'd be correct, Gerald. But mark me, Gerald, for it doesn't matter."

Of course, monetary resources have been poured into the project to secure the most reliable and efficient system to aid our alliance members' financial status, with President Bennett declaring that the conference will "secure the world economy against the iron grip of Fascism."\n\nBennett has promised the agreement will promote economic prosperity among the OFN's members, allocating resources among one another rather than reaching out to the more nefarious members of the international market. Whispers of the creation of a World Bank circulate widely among those present, in order safeguard each other from financial failures to ensure that exploitation by rival powers does not occur. With such a system in place, the OFN would create a new means to prospering economically.\n\nHowever, the scope of the agreement has led to some apprehension. National resources would be diverted in order to comply with the terms of the agreement, a pooling of funds to cover the mistakes of other OFN members.

It was an exceptionally nice day, and not just for the view; today, another blow would be delivered to the Dixiecrats. In past weeks, stories of police brutality on protesting African Americans had been modified to a slight degree. These stories were then published in official R-D media, including a particularly sad story a few hours ago: the killing of a black teenager during a race riot in Charleston. The story was slightly altered such that the teen was simply trying to get through the crowd. In actual fact, the police report claims he assaulted a police officer. It was just a touch of hyperbole.\n\nA knock came at the door. "Come in," the President said.\n\nA tall, thin man in a dark suit walked in, holding a notebook. "Ah, James," Bennett said warmly, "what can I do for you?"\n\n"Well, it's about the recent stories you and your party have been propagating."\n\nBennett shrugged. "What about them?"\n\n"They're false. Objectively so. Sooner or later, news about these falsifications will get out, and it might actually hurt us in the long run."\n\n"No, it won't.

To alleviate this issue while still achieving some civil rights for all, the President has devised a plan: to mire the application of the bill in bureaucracy.\n\nA series of committees and subcommittees will be created nationwide to determine how exactly to apply the new legislation in their assigned communities. Their decision will then be reviewed by a higher authority, and then accepted and implemented.\n\nJust today, the first step towards building these committees and bureaucratic systems was taken, with the swearing-in of the first members of the Federal Committee for Civil Rights Implementation. Headed by a bipartisan group of politicians, it will function as the main oversight board for Civil Rights across the nation. President Bennett has called it "a momentous occasion in the history of our country: the first step towards racial equality.""

Pro-civil rights groups have already come out in celebration, emboldened by the president's support in their efforts to advocate 'freedom for all Americans' while more conservative sects have been quick to denounce these 'tyrannical measures.'\n\nSince its creation in the mid-1800s, the Republican party has argued for the rights of African-Americans, and the support of the level-headed and pragmatic Bennett has only encouraged them to pursue this agenda. Firmly believing that the time has come for equality before the law in the United States, Republican politicians have now proposed various laws that would extend political and social equality to all Americans. The proposed Voting Rights Act, which would grant universal suffrage to citizens regardless of race, is the first of many measures to achieve these goals. The passage of these acts will be hotly contested but hopefully assured.\n\nThe effects of this decision on the two-party coalition have yet to be seen, but projections do not look good. Many Southern Dixiecrats feel betrayed by this sudden change of course, and, in the confusion, may be swayed to factions that better represent their constituents. The social upheaval of these measures will also surely have long-lasting effects on the nation."

The effects of this decision will surely be felt for years to come, both in policy and in the makeup of the already-weakened coalition.\n\nSo far, Democrats have taken an entirely conservative stance in the Civil Rights debate, arguing against provisions to outlaw race-based discrimination. Their newfound dominance in Congress will favor the status quo in segregationist states, leaving voting rights and other hotly contested topics to their discretion. How this will affect any previous civil rights legislation is uncertain.\n\nThe uneasy alliance between the liberal and conservative wings of the coalition is now in doubt, as many Republicans have been quick to denounce the party establishment. In the wake of these divisions, the NPP may find support from these politicians as well. Regardless, it seems the segregationist institutions of the South have gotten a new lease on life."

In the months since then, the Democrats have been rapidly waning in power. The R-D's have always been mainly Republicans, but the two groups were generally seen as equals. Now, after months of declining support, the Democrats are the shadow party: they are the second among equals.

The group is splintering over issues of whether or not to pursue further Civil Rights legislation and whether to continue working with the Democrats. Meanwhile, the Democrats, traditionally playing second-fiddle to the Republicans, have taken charge.

Also included in his speech was a warning to avoid 'political extremes,' stressing that the best solutions come from discussion, not partisan division. While withholding outright endorsement for either course of action, he has also suggested the possibility for compromise, but the form that would take was left unspecified. "Either way," he said, "we must stay true to our American values, not those of extremists.""

America was a constantly changing and shifting country, and strong leadership would be needed to keep it grounded in safety, security, and just sanity.\n\nAfter a long walk which had, frankly, failed to clear the President's mind, the sight of Frances Bennett, First Lady of the United States, was a welcome sight.

It was the only respite between the paperwork and phone calls that the President still handled, despite explicit orders to rest.\n\n"Yes, Ford, exactly, we need to stick Muskie and Robertson together to deal with the Australian work."

"Absalom figured he understood the situation with the budget and found the best solution with the expenses of the South: a flat cut for agricultural development and pre-established agricultural production zones."\n\nBennett was stunned.

Already, the North was raising a ruckus about 'Bennett's Jim Crow,' as Michael Harrington had argued a few days earlier. But much of the rest of the country seemed at peace - though he imagined that there would be some restiveness in the South once the Department of Justice sent its people to hold its non-binding consultations with state authorities. America, exhausted after years of turmoil, had seemed ready to put the matter to sleep.\n\n'What does our soothed conscience in Washington mean for the African-American?' President Bennett recalled Robert Kennedy's scathing words in the press, following the Senate vote. He was troubled, of course. In the face of America's most trying political crisis since the Civil War, who wouldn't be afraid that they hadn't done enough?\n\nHe looked at the image of Jesus on the cross. Bennett was a faithful man, and this - this Act was what he could be comfortable with. Never mind Thomas Monson; this was a matter for Bennett alone, a dilemma shared by any man of faith in office. Bennett had been true to himself, and that would have to be enough for America."

WFB.556.desc:0 "Good morning, Senators, I appreciate your diligence in making it out here to work this early. Please, take a seat, we have much to discuss." With the President's words, the Republicans sat down across from the President's desk. "Gentlemen, the anxieties revolving around the Silver Act's upcoming vote could lead to a complete collapse of support. As President, I cannot allow factionalism to tear apart our country at the seams; thus, gentlemen, you have all been chosen to head to Chicago to meet with Harrington in C-NPP territory. If we can't patch up the economy by ourselves, then we'll have to extend our hand out to the inner cities. I know things haven't been the best between the Democrats and the Republicans recently, but let's try to smooth all that over, what do you say, gentlemen?" The Senators nodded and quickly left to meet with Harrington himself.\n\nThe city had been bustling with activity, and after waiting around for traffic, the Senators' driver dropped them off at a bustling office building on the corner of Ninth street. Finally, the men found their seat across from the Missourian politician himself, looking as annoyed as he seemed impatient. "Well come on, we're busy all day trying to fix what Bennett and the Democrats couldn't." he asked. While sorting through papers, "Now, what is it that you all need over here?" "Well, Mr. Harrington, the President is looking to propose a deal with you and all of the C-NPP." one Senator said. For the first time in the conversation, Harrington stopped sifting through papers and turned to look at the man. "You're telling me the leader of the Democrats and our nation itself has decided to strike a deal with us? After all the harassment, he finally wants to take a step down and offer us something? Now, please, let me know what the President could try to offer us after all of what we, and the miners of the United States, have had to bear?" After taking a deep breath, one of the Senators spoke up, "Now, I know things have been rough between you and Bennett, but he's offering a direct promise here. He's worried about passing the Silver Act; so, if you choose to get your branch to favor the bill, President Bennett has offered a clause which would ensure the jobs of silver miners across the United States, along with a firm agreement to allow the R-D's to open up greater communication to the C-NPP." The leader of the C-NPP tapped his fingers across the desk while offering a look of suspicion towards the Republicans. "Tell me, what makes the President so willing to finally work with us?" Harrington said.\n\n"Because to be honest, sir, President Bennett believes that if we don't fix the economy now, no one's going to be able to.""

Three combat veterans, three Southern Democratic Senators, three figures in the Silver Act vote. "Good morning, gentlemen." He said. "Let's face the light here: the Silver Act's vote is creeping up, but the Congress remains polarized, and I fear the worst; so, I'm sending you three down to the Serpent of the South himself, George C. Wallace to guarantee the extra votes. Understood?"\n\nAnd there we were. The room was silent. The three of us were silent. The Governor of Alabama just sat there, quiet, the whole fucking building was just quiet. "Senators, may I ask what you three are doing down here in my office?" he said, as the pouring of whiskey into five separate glasses flowed in front of us. One Senator picked up first, coughing, "Well, sir, the President sent us here to-" "Oh, my apologies, gentlemen, please, the travel must have dried your throats; please, enjoy a drink." He interrupted. "Don't worry, Mr. Governor, I do not drink." I said, shooting me with eyes like daggers. "Now, as I was saying, sir, President Bennett sent us here to discuss the proceedings of the Silver Act coming up, and how we can align our interests for the betterment of the nation." the Senator said. Wallace swiveled his chair to face the man, stating, "Align our interests? Funny little phrase you put together there. Now, what could the President offer that I may want?" The air in the room tightened like a noose around a criminal's throat. "Well, segregation, sir." the younger Senator with the Southern drawl voiced.\n\nWallace turned."So, Bennett's finally ready to ease down on protecting the Afros? Well, you have my attention, gentlemen. Go on." the Governor asked with a wicked smirk and unending stare. "Well," I finally spoke up, "the President would be glad to have your support, as well as the FR-NPP's support of the terms of the Silver Act. In exchange, he'll look into delaying the work towards Civil Rights legislation." The room stood silent, and still as Wallace's face twisted with contemplation. Suddenly, the room exploded with the slamming of the Governor's fist onto the desk, succeeded by a fierce cackling. "Well, gentlemen, you can go tell Bennett that Governor Wallace shall be considering his proposal to rectify relations with the NPP and the Democrats. For now, however." He stopped short, clearing his throat. "A toast, to the people of the United States." I shakily led our side of the toast and downed the liquor before leaving."

##GOLDWATER

POLITICS_GLD_DESC:0 ""A Christian, a Jew, a pilot and a senator walked into a bar in DC. 'What can I get you, Mr. Goldwater?' asked the tender." Thus goes one of the jokes Barry Morris Goldwater tells about himself, and it reflects the complicated and colorful background of the man dominating the Southern and Western wings of the R-D Party. Born in the Arizona Territory to a Jewish father and Episcopalian mother who ran a department store together, the young Goldwater lived an unremarkable life until the outbreak of the Second World War, when he would become a reserve officer in the USAAF, and a pilot with the Ferry Command.\n\nMoving supplies around the various war fronts in Asia and Europe, Goldwater would come to develop a great loathing of both his fascist enemies and what he viewed as the failures of the Kennedy administration's peace policies. Following the defeat, Goldwater's aggressive rhetoric and unabashed social conservatism propelled him to the Senator's seat for Arizona in 1953, replacing the retiring Democrat MacFarland.\n\nGoldwater rose to become one of the leaders of the Democratic faction in the R-D's, resisting recruitment attempts by both the Republicans, due to his personal animosity with Eisenhower, and the NPP, which he views as too fixated on Japan alone and dominated by socialist radicals. His charisma and fiery presence soon set him on a path to the White House.\n\nNow, with Goldwater swept into power by a wave of popular support, the world looks across the seas in hope or worry, as the USA takes another step towards full military mobilization against its fascist enemies around the world."

But his associations with the likes of Donald Regan and his "voodoo economics," and his incendiary anti-fascist views, have made many of those in power uneasy.

But that was before, and this is now, when the R-Ds need to present a united front.

Taxes will be flattened, as will monopolies from unions to corporations to the Federal government itself. The free market with proper nurturing can finely adjudicate many problems on its own and, as ever, the people most directly concerned are financially capable without Federal interference. And if not, it could be that the government has enculturated them to be slavish and dependent, and deteriorated their self-efficiency.

The larger body of Federal aid, social programs, and stimulus pick-me-ups comprise the spiteful organism that primarily embodies said "welfareism". It stunts the people and businesses by making the government a strident economic competitor in the market which drives competition off the rails rather than the government searching for non-competitive foul play as like its delegated responsibilities from the trustbusting 1910's. It worsens the government by giving it a part it does not know how to play with the competency instilled from the consequences of being a private body who must suffer the results it reaps from both successful and failed operations.

No more will the Keynesian doctrine of self-debt be permitted to crawl along the floorboards of the Capitol and White House, debts will be addressed by unfailingly consistent payment plans where possible or go un-incurred in the first place. If the government can't pay it, loans should become a last resort rather than a convenient stepping stone to gratifying the social magicianship of big-headed policy men. If it involves profligately overarching regulation, it should be examined to see how it can be cut down rather than gymnastically complicated into being "workable".

Rumsfeld specifically has an interest in higher technology, aeronautic war-making, including using satellites more robustly, developing sleeker spy planes with better photographic powers, and honing airstrikes into a precise art form which devastate pressure points rather than merely carpet bombing South Africa into whatever predated the Stone Age.

That is, until the modern helicopter. Mobile, speedy, low flying, and bristling with machine guns, a properly outfitted Huey chopper is the new Sherman, and arguably less fragile.

From the thunderous roars of Niagara Falls' waters to the Grand Canyon's towering ravines, not one inch of America's three thousand-mile length lacks in the divine beauty envied by men and sung by its poets. Its forests, its waters, its hills and fields and mountains -- our nation's natural plenty is and should be an object of pride for those fortunate to call these their own.\n\nYet men still seek to imperil America's pristine majesties with misdeeds to sate their own greed; much of them, in fact, are companies with the gall to call themselves Americans. President Goldwater may be an ardent believer in free enterprise, but above all he is the democratically elected steward of the Lord's most beautiful creation. No burden is too heavy, nor cost too great, against their defense from the corrupting tendrils of mankind's pollution."

The ancient caldera's most famous geyser forcefully ejects jets of superheated water from Earth to Heaven, seeming to all and sundry like a wrathful pillar from the Old Testament. Yet for all its awe-inspiring power, Old Faithful and its adjunct supervolcano is helpless against the clouds of industrial smoke that clog its airs, or against the heaps of scrap metal that defile its lands and waters.\n\nThe President feels it is only fitting to announce his next great effort before such a strong, yet helpless creation -- for is that not what now best describes American nature?"

Thus, a hypothetical "Environmental Protection Agency" will better harness the country's will towards the stewardship of its natural bounty than the quiltwork, often underfunded programs of its individual states.\n\nThe President has directed his staff to draft plans for such an agency, keeping in mind the likelihood that Congress and its lobbyists will approve of it.

An undemocratic travesty it may be, but such is as part of life in the Beltway as sunshine and traffic jams. Presidents who fail to take the lobbyists' grip into account become lame ducks after their first hundred days.\n\nPresident Goldwater thinks likewise -- but not to appease them.

It is through laws and decrees that such hands are kept away from such a precious resource, for as recent memory unfortunately shows, men are happy to corrupt clean water into impure water without the visible hand of government to chastize their foolery.\n\nNow more than ever, President Goldwater believes, the federal government needs such laws before America's fresh waters are polluted fully.

What Goldwater will their narrative depict? He hoped it would be Goldwater the environmentalist: The ardent champion of the greatest among the American people's shared heritages. But it was equally likely that the Goldwater they paint will resemble a tree-hugging dictator more than a civilized man.\n\nWith a swig, Barry emptied his mug before forcing his attention towards other Presidential matters.

Washington's own kingmaker was straightforward enough: If President Goldwater required the FBI's help in uncovering "compromising information" about America's extremists, then he need only ask.\n\nIn better times, the Director's offer would merit a warning shot for its sheer unconstitutionality.

Clothed in blood-stained red parroting the false German prophet's heresies, socialism has left more scars on Uncle Sam and his children than all the world's fascists put together. Like the hydra of myth, socialism grows despite injuries that would kill lesser men, and it will return to our shores again and again until our cities are crushed beneath its crimson feet.\n\nAll American presidents are duty-bound to cull socialism before it grows into a juggernaut.

Some sympathetic, if unusual, fellows from the opposition congratulated him in private -- apparently "despite (his) traitorous heritage" to quote one of the letters verbatim -- for conclusively dealing with one of their party's unwanted sores.\n\nHe knew better of course. Only fools with the arrogance of Hercules, but with none of his strength, would say that the socialist hydra was slain for good.

However they disagree on the means to achieve peace and prosperity for our people, either side's adherents can take comfort in knowing that the other will eventually be swayed to theirs because of the common goal they share.\n\nFascism, on the other hand, deifies unthinking obedience and lionizes the omnipotence of strongmen. Nowhere else can one find an ideology more anathematic to American values than the Reich's slavish adherence to the supremacy of one race over all mankind. To combat this unnatural foe, and their present sympathizers within the United States, President Goldwater was convinced to set aside its century-old blood feud with socialism for the time being."

Often these solutions involved the brutal acts his Nazi inspirations conduct, chief among them wanton violence and the persecution of America's sheltered oppressed.\n\nJust as mildly put is President Goldwater's antipathy for a man who would shoot him out of a principled hatred for his father's ancestry. An intern questioned if his personal spite for the beloved fascist had driven the order to ruin him with blackmail from CIA infiltrators; to that, the Arizonan simply answered with a knowing smile and a pithy about cutting a snake's head off before it can slither away."

All he now needs is a convincing enough excuse to lock them up for life..."

Why else would a tablecloth parade founded in direct opposition to the evil that is respect for your black compatriots apparently enjoy their ebony as much as any hot-blooded teenager with a roaming imagination?\n\nPersonally, he couldn't care less about the smut some lynching schmuck consumes.

The good Director likened the experience to opening a matryoshka doll: Opening one reveals another, and another, and another, all the way to Washington, D.C. and the party leadership. With the big names his agents had dug out, and the debauchery they'd kept far away from the public's noses, an anonymous midnight leak into the Beltway's press corps will tear a third of the NPP apart the following morning.\n\nThe bleary-eyed President approved Director Hoover's innocuous suggestion before he went back to sleep.

So much for a man who thought himself an American Hitler -- son of a Jew nipped his little putsch in the bud, imagine that! The irony was thick as buttermilk, and just as sweet.\n\nBut the cherry on top was a nondescript letter from one Gus Hall. Goldwater swore he could hear grumbling from the neat cursive that offered the communist's congratulations and thanks.\n\nAll told, America's true loyalties reasserted themselves as soon as its fascist malcontents began cannibalizing one another to irrelevance. No friend to the Reich's poisoned honey indeed."

Resultingly, some sense of common decency and good faith had returned to the debates in Capitol Hill -- minuscule compared to the genteel of pre-Depression Beltway politics, but present nevertheless. It was fair to say that, despite the rhetoric bandied about, Congress was the friendliest these last few days than it had been in twenty years.\n\nGreat men often tell of the long nights and sleep-tossing agony before and after making a hard choice.

Such behavior will eat away at the slivers of unity the government has left; yet if they break away, then the hope of a functioning Congress will soon follow.

He sought to advance the rights of states, but in doing so had compelled the federal government to commit many egregious violations against them. His hatred for the Black had instead become the Blacks' greatest asset. By the time his face kissed the White House's lawn, support for civil rights had reached highs unprecedented -- and he has only himself to blame.\n\nNow it is up to the new President to address the reintensified debate over civil rights.

Underfunded and overburdened, schools all over the country languished for years as they presided over the lowest graduation rates in decades.\n\nThe wounds may have already been dealt, the President says, but it is not too late to stymie the bleeding and restore the quality education Americans had once enjoyed."

In a few years' time, Wallace had single handedly impeded America's economy from improving for years yet.\n\nThis mistake must be rectified not only for the good of the nation, but also for the good of its citizenry.

Better that each race assign their own skilled to teach their own children, rather than coerce either race to fulfill a task in which they cannot possibly succeed. Again, so they went.\n\nThese seemingly sensible reassurances, expectedly, turned out to be window dressing for more sinister intentions. For while white districts carried on business as usual, black districts faced desolation from their already meagre budget dwindling into flies through a combination of budget cuts and redistricting.

Streams of money, once dried but now restored, have slaked the thirst of schools longing for new textbooks and classrooms. Teachers and students return to their desks in droves.

This unique arrangement justifiably requires some form of leeway for the states subsumed into one politic to act on their own accord. In most cases, giving these states the powers they enjoy as Constitutional right is a goal worth lauding.\n\nThe same cannot be said for Wallace's own acts to "improve" states' rights. Put short, a man who wields the federal government like a mallet to force laws into Congress only has states rights as a tangential goal at best. We should best get to work undoing the damage he's dealt to an otherwise noble goal's repute."

As expected of a simpleton with little in the way of tact, Wallace never once erred from speaking of "restoring the rights of states to choose their destiny" in the same breath as "keeping the equals separate". Did he truly clamor for states' rights when he attempted to enforce segregation in the North? Or when he cut much-needed funds for public schools in the poorest of America's states?\n\nNo two ways around it: Wallace exploited the public's sympathy for the liberties of their states in order to violate these very same liberties across two-thirds of America. It will take time to untangle the mess he had left behind to local laws, but restoring faith in an integral aspect of America's political system is worth any effort."

With the disrepute it had gained under Wallace's tender ministrations, only a proportionate amount of outreach and reassurances to the once-bitten American people can ever convince them to throw their weight into it again. That said, the South will surely look favorably upon someone willing to help their dearest cause at its very nadir."

Subsequently, citing the urgency and need to protect the environment from degradation, the president has signed the bill into law through executive order, bypassing both houses of Congress. The administration insists on the legality of the executive order, while citing its necessity in order to ensure America's nature is preserved. Some voices within the republican half of the Republican-Democrats have denounced this move by the administration as authoritarian. Nevertheless, few others have protested at this measure of the administration.\n\nThe bill is a great step forward in environmental legislation. Regardless of his firm belief in laissez-faire, President Barry Goldwater has always had a special appreciation for America's natural beauty, enough that he would see it protected by the federal government. Particularly younger voters seem to agree with and appreciate the president's environmentalist tendencies, making it likely that he is to enjoy a small surge in support among this demographic.\n\nWith the bill, the president's bill has created a new federal agency: the EPA, or Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA will be made responsible for ensuring that all of America's nature will be preserved and not subjected to needless and excessive pollution, through helping develop and enforce environmental regulation in cooperation with Congress.\n\nThe president can rest a little easier knowing that America's beauty is preserved for the next generation."

"The first thing I did was get my staff to create this, with a brief description of each program the federal government runs, so we can figure out what we can get rid of."\n\nGoldwater flipped the page to the first program, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, the AAA, and quickly read the description. "Pay farmers to not plant some of their land, and sell excess livestock to the government?" He frowned, grabbed the page, and with a satisfying rip, tore it from the binder. "That's the first one to go."\n\nThe President stuck his finger part way into the pages, and flipped the binder there. The Works Progress Administration, WPA. "Provide contracts to companies to hire unemployed workers to build parks, post offices and other public infrastructure. And hire writers, musicians and painters to create art?" He tore that page out with a particular vengeance. "The last thing the government should be doing is paying anyone to splatter paint on a canvas. If someone wants to buy their art, then they should make it worth being sold."\n\nGoldwater turned to the last program, the Veterans Pension Act of 1947. "Provide a pension to all members of the US Armed Forces who served in the Second World War," Goldwater read. He looked at it for a long moment, before grabbing a pen. "Getting rid of all the pensions would be a terrible move. But if a former soldier is healthy, fit, and working, I don't think he needs an extra hundred bucks a month.""I agree, Mr. President," Secretary Regan said, a grin on his face. "I've already marked about a third of the programs that we can get rid of without too much fuss. Most of the rest can be amalgamated, and then have their combined budgets reduced to an appropriate level."\n\n"I want this binder to be less than half the size," Goldwater said, slamming the binder shut. "By the time we are done, this should be a pamphlet, not a doorstop.""

The fact that millions of dollars a year are being spent to prop up thousands of farmers in the South when their crops don't yield as much as expected due to the lack of fertilizer and overused soil has become the newest bone of contention with Treasury Secretary Don Regan and his supporters, who seek to let the free markets determine who prospers and who doesn't. Why would anyone be willing to pay farmers to lose money? If they can't cut it, then they should sell their land to more successful farmers and get out!\n\nAlready there are protests by farmers throughout the South at state capitol buildings and federal courthouses, angry at how the government has been treating them over the past decade.\n\n"First all the Civil Rights nonsense, talking about making the blacks our equals. And now they want to destroy our livelihoods? There won't be a single free farmer left in Dixie by the end of the year if this happens. Everyone will be broke, or no better than a slave!"\n\nAlready activists have been going to small towns throughout Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and Mississippi, telling the farmers about what their Democrat President is trying to do, and how they can fight back by supporting the National Progressive Party, especially the Far Right faction of the NPP. It remains to be seen if it will be enough to topple the stranglehold the Democrats have had on the South since the end of Reconstruction, but some Democrats are clearly afraid for their jobs in the next election."

So catchy names and programs with a word-scramble of acronyms were created. The SSA, the WPA, the AAA, the FRA, NIRA and several dozen more. Slogans like "The New Deal," "the Fair Deal," and more have been bandied about for just as long. Every single one a further burden on the taxpayer, all of them a further expansion of the government.\n\nBarry Goldwater is going to be different. Instead of making the government fatter, he is imposing a strict diet. Gone will be all the silly letters. The bloated budget will be slimmed down. By the end of his administration, the US Federal Government will be a sleeker, slimmer, and more effective government, doing what governments do best: maintain an army, negotiate with other countries, and stay the hell away from ordinary Americans.\n\nThe problem is that a lot of ordinary Americans have been brainwashed for two generations, told that the government will always help them when they need it. Did you lose your job? Here's a cheque! Did you retire without saving up enough? Here's a cheque! Is your farm or business underwater because you made some bad decisions? Don't you worry, because here's a cheque! The problem is those cheques add up, and add up fast. Now the US is in debt and in crisis.\n\nThirty years of coddling, consoling, instead of toughening and strengthening. Americans now hurt themselves, and cry to the government to help them. But no more. It's time for some tough love. In order to save America, Goldwater is going to have to make some tough choices. Unpopular choices. Choices that others, like the lily-livered Republicans or the Fascist-Communist NPP are loathe to make. But he's ready to do that. Anything to save America from itself."

In fact, the proposed cuts that are coming out now seem to actually be rather moderate, and more technical than anything. Few programs are being shut down, while others will be merged to realize efficiencies in administration and the bureaucracy, which usually is the largest expense anyway in these kinds of assistance programs. Some funding for grants to states on health, education, food and shelter assistance and more is also being reduced, and more requirements are being put in place to ensure that only those that actually need it are receiving the funds.\n\nIn general, no one is happy with the budget, but few are really angry over it either: Democrats are displeased that the spending isn't even more drastic, while Republicans are disappointed that funding for some benefits that they consider worthwhile and important has been reduced. The NPP is on both extremes: demanding more social spending, or demanding the whole system of Social Security and Medicare and more be totally demolished.

While he didn't get the chance in 1964 to put his plan into motion, now he might get the chance with a conservative like Goldwater in the White House. They had both worked together in the Senate for several years before hand, and Goldwater liked what he heard from Bennett's speeches and proposals for more international trade and re-establishing the Gold Standard. However, Goldwater decided against bringing Bennett onto his cabinet as Secretary of the Treasury, instead going for the hardline conservative-libertarian Donald Regan, as he wanted someone he could trust in the Senate to help get his proposals through. Since most of it was Bennett's brainchild, so much the better.\n\nBy pursuing the twin goals of Free Trade and the Gold Standard, Goldwater and Bennett have what they perceive to be a winning strategy: increased prosperity, an end to the economic stagnation of the previous generation, and giving the American people hope for the future. Now, what shape Free Trade would take is still a matter of debate in the halls of power, as Goldwater's anti-fascist views means that increased trade with Germany and Japan would be abhorant to him, while concern over the size, wealth and even political will of the OFN members mean they aren't as great as markets as business leaders would like. And restoring a true gold standard can mean either great things if done right, or a huge economic crash if they fail.

 GLD.21.desc:0 "For the past seventy years, the American economy grew by leaps and bounds. We did so by embracing ideas and technology that older powers, content with their empires and wealth, ignored or disdained. But we were never daunted by distance or space, by lack of expertise or technical knowhow. We forged our way across a continent, united Pacific and Atlantic with ribbons of steel, filled a land with settlers with the masses driven from their homelands. We embraced electricity, the assembly line, the telephone, the automobile, the radio, the airplane and most recently, the television.\n\nMost of these inventions were developed or created, or refined and perfected, here within the United States. But to achieve these great feats, to the point where we've made more steel than both Nazi Germany and the Japanese Empire combined, and built an economy and nation far richer than any in the world had seen before, we isolated ourselves. Tariffs were high, and trade limited. We shunned the outside world, and in turn, they shunned us. We contented ourselves with making our cars, our washing machines, our televisions, and selling them to ourselves. Sure, some would be exported to Canada, some to Mexico. But never in huge numbers, and only limited ways.\n\nBut tariffs and trade barriers is a mark of one of two kinds of economies: a young, struggling one, seeking to carve out their place in the world in the face of international competition. Or it's the sign of a degenerate and fearful people. Corrupt leaders and greedy businessmen who content themselves to grow fat off a people that are hostage to an economy of overpriced and underperforming goods, monopolies that seek only to further their own wealth and power by sucking it from their nation, instead of challenging the world, seeking new markets, offering good quality and service for a fair price.\n\nWe are no longer a weak and struggling country, so that excuse has no holding. But are we a nation of cartels and monopolies? Are we willing to just lounge and laze in decadence, letting our standards slip and prices rise? I say no. America can compete with anyone in the world. If someone can do something better, we should learn from it. We should be willing to embrace trade with the whole world, with no limits or restrictions.

Are you willing to spend money on products made in prison camps? I think the answer is clear."\n\nUnfortunately like much of American politics, the answer is never so black and white. While embargos with the German Reich, the Italian Empire, and the Empire of Japan have been in place since the end of the war, they have steadily loosened and opened up in time: American TVs travel across the ocean for German beer, Japanese cars, or Italian wine. After all, with two-thirds of the world, and nearly half of the population of the globe under their sway, totally cutting links with the fascist and ultra-nationalist powers of the world would be like cutting off your arm. At least many of the big businessmen, many of them on the more right wing side of the Republican-Democrats, are oft to say such.\n\nBut there has always been an uneasiness, a disgust, with trading with such nations. Such goods are not readily available, usually for the simple reason that no one wants them. To drive a Mercedes is to mark you out as a German sympathizer, maybe even a supporter of Yockey's madness. To buy a Mitsubishi car shows that the thousands that died in the Pacific were in vain, to value foreignness and efficiency over patriotism and love of country.\n\nGoldwater, as the valiant anti-fascist he is, tapped into that sentiment in a big way. To him, "Free Trade" means more than low tariffs and few restrictions: it means trading with democracies, with nations that value freedom and liberty over totalitarianism and iron fisted rule. Many of the leading Democrats, businessmen serving their nation in Congress for a period before returning back to their family business or the big corporations, are horrified at this "Goldwater Way." Some have even come out and said so. But the public reaction is overwhelmingly in favor of Goldwater's idea of "Free Trade." It's even seen as a courageous act by an otherwise loyal Democrat, to stand up to the wealthy elites, to stand up for what he thinks, what he knows, is right."

There are three paths forward, as far as Goldwater can tell. The first, and most simple, is to keep the Organization of Free Nations as a simple military alliance, focused on the external Fascist threat from Europe, Asia and Africa. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and the more hawkish advisors are in favor of this course of action, to keep America and her allies focused on the true threat.\n\nAnother group, lead by the Secretary of State and those seeking to push diplomacy, seek to use the OFN as a force to encourage free trade around the world, especially with nations that may not be the most democratic or open, but are still important geo-political partners to the US. By convincing these nations to open their economies to the OFN, they will be tied even more directly to America, and those levers can be used in the future.\n\nThe final group, promoted by the Secretary of Commerce and business leaders, seek to make the OFN more than a military alliance, and even more than just to push for free trade around the world, but as the establishment of an entire economic bloc. Reducing tariffs, cutting regulations, and establishing common standards, all to push for more economic ties between the various nations, making everyone richer in the process.\n\nThe decision has been made, and now it's time for Goldwater to make the announcement.\n\n"I've gathered you here today to discuss...""

"Therefore, it's vital that the OFN seek to strengthen all members, not simply through military means, but by increasing economic and social ties between all of us."\n\nPublic response has been mixed so far. In some countries, smaller businesses are afraid of being undermined or even elbowed out by larger American companies, while labor unions in the US are raising concerns that good paying manufacturing jobs will be sent overseas to areas with lower costs. Some countries also have anonymously expressed concern that America will have way too much power, being the largest economy in the OFN, and could be using the smaller nations in a "neo-imperialist" setup.

Despite a last ditch attempt at a Filibuster from an NPP Senator that stretched late into the night, calling the bill a "...disaster in the making for the hardworking American..." Yockey's supporters denounced it as a return to the failed interventionist politics of the past. However, the bill passed with the majority support from the R-Ds and the more moderate members of the NPP, as it was fairly non-controversial in the halls of power. Outside Washington, though, some commentators have expressed reservations about the financial cost of removing tariffs, and some have talked about the impact on good paying American jobs in comparison to cheaper labour elsewhere in the OFN. There are also concerns over the unilateral action that is not being reciprocated by other OFN members immediately, over all the opinion on the bill is seen as a net positive for the US.\n\nWith the bill now on it's way to be signed by the President, soon the vast majority of tariffs will be erased from the law books, allowing products from all over the OFN to be sold in America without the artificial price increased by taxing imports. This will be a victory for everyone: the price of raw materials, oil, consumer goods and more from nations like Canada, Australia and South Africa will be cheaper for US companies and consumers, while giving an economic boost to America's friends and allies."

The opposition, especially the Left and Yockey factions within the NPP, joined together to defeat the bill. This defeat dealt a massive blow to President Goldwater's efforts to slash tariffs on products from OFN allies. The unilateral effort to remove trade barriers was supposed to make trade between America and her allies cheaper and more expedient, which would have benefited all sides, or so Goldwater and the RDs have claimed.\n\nThe L-NPP was opposed from the get go, as they claimed the bill would pulverize the American economy, and more importantly, the American worker. By allowing products from nations with lower labor costs, it could see many highly-paid workers lose their jobs, which would cause ripple effects throughout the nation. The Yockey branch of the NPP was even more vitriolic in their denunciations of the Free Trade Act, considering it little more than a tool to drag America into the morass of global politics, and damage their "America First" ideals.\n\nHowever, the impact could be even worse on President Goldwater than a failed bill to lower some tariffs: with the extremes of the NPP now holding the balance of power in the Senate, that can only mean one of two things: either Goldwater is going to have to compromise to get anything done, or he's already been rendered a lame-duck president. Neither is particularly good for the administration, and it remains to be seen if he can fix it."

However, concerns regarding the removal of tariffs, the dismantling of import quotas, the harmonization of regulations and the extension of copyright protections need to be addressed in the NATC negotiations. Labor unions in Canada and the US are afraid that big businesses will seek to lower costs by building factories in the cheaper and less unionized Mexico, while farmers in Canada and Mexico are afraid of being overwhelmed by American food without the import quotas they currently have, or Hollywood and American TV networks destroying her neighbor's cultural institutions. And of course, nationalist forces in all three countries are reluctant, if not downright hostile, to the idea of making all three countries more open, facilitating immigration, culture and trade. Mexican's especially believe that the NATC is just a way to get their nation to join the American lead Organization of Free Nations alliance, which would end their decades of neutrality.\n\nAll these problems, and many more, will have to be overcome if the NATC is to be put in place.

Some call it Libertarian, some call it Fiscal Conservatism. Barry Goldwater calls it Common Sense.\n\nEver since the Great Depression, Washington has steadily gained more and more power. At first it was welcomed: some make work programs to get the unemployed workers back to work. Then with the war and the mobilization for it, came inspectors, support for unions, restrictions, rationing of resources, all called temporary, all to win the war.\n\nBut even the war ended in humiliation and defeat, the technocratic, heavy handed bureaucrats and their stalwart allies in Congress doubled down, clinging to their offices and positions, throwing more and more money at every problem. But this only bloated every element of government, ballooned an already astronomical debt. Business was strangled under the increasing cost and frustration, leaving only those massive corporations with armies of lawyers to survive and stagnate, becoming monopolies. Unions too, for what are they but bloated bureaucracies that only survive to steal money from hard working Americans?

Yellowstone's quiet beauty brought him back to the simpler, happier days of his boyhood, running across Arizona's scorching scrublands with his brother and his sisters. Every American deserved to grow up like that, raised in nature's loving embrace.\n\nThe director let the President know they were ready. Goldwater took his place behind the podium, his back to the expanse of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. The President had long been committed to the cause of environmentalism and the preservation of America's natural beauty, and he intended this to be his seminal speech to introduce the public to his love for America's National Parks, and to hopefully sway them to support his program for greater environmental protections and regulations. Goldwater often found it difficult to believe that so many Americans were willing to sacrifice nature's bounty in exchange for the pollution of industry and the soullessness of the urban sprawl. Taking a deep breath to steady his thoughts, he began.\n\n"My fellow Americans. Today I speak to you from Yellowstone National Park, greatest among America's natural monuments. Fifty years ago, this great nation made the commitment to protect and preserve our natural heritage, for these parks belong not to any man but to us all. I would carry on this proud tradition, and revitalise our national parks so that they may be enjoyed by our children and our grandchildren, and all who come after."\n\nAnd so he continued, extolling the virtues of the national parks and laying out his plan to enact a series of programs to preserve the environment and help the national parks grow and prosper.

The creation of the Environmental Protection Agency would be made public the following morning in a press conference, when he would, once again, face the flashing lights and the dark eyes of the cameras he had come to know so well.\n\nKnocking back his coffee, Goldwater allowed a small smile to grow as the scorching liquid warmed the inside of his chest. He reflected on the obstacles he had skirted around or smashed through to bring the EPA into being. The corrupt lobbyists he had to silence, the local governments who needed to be brought into line, the difficulty of getting the details right with his advisors, and finally the bloody path he'd had to carve through Congress just to get them to read the bill. It had been a battle well fought, and a victory well earned.

President Goldwater steepled his fingers as he looked down blearily at what he'd been working on for the past six hours, trying to devise an ideal blueprint for his Environmental Protection Agency. He'd spoken to his advisors the previous day: Rockefeller strongly supported it, Regan disapproved, insisting it would be a waste of government funds, and McNamara and Curtis were relatively blase and disinterested. Nevertheless, they'd thrown around a lot of ideas, some of which, to the President's surprise, were even half-decent. After waking up, he had immediately started working on a plan of what the EPA should look like.\n\nAnd, goddamn it all, he was nowhere closer to figuring it out than he had been yesterday! Through exhausted eyes, Goldwater once again looked over his work so far, trying to make it all come together in his mind. The EPA couldn't be too radical, but it couldn't be limp-wristed either or he might as well just not create it. It needed teeth, but it shouldn't be so powerful as to completely alienate the world of business and their 'friends' in Congress. And, of course, there was the small matter of how exactly the EPA would be funded, meaning which program would have its budget drained to bankroll it.\n\nThe President rested his chin on his hand. So many problems, all requiring decisions. He couldn't let himself forget that what he was doing here was important, that it would change the lives of Americans for decades to come. Picking up the phone, Goldwater decided to arrange for a press conference to announce that the Environmental Protection Agency was more than just a dream, that he was serious about preserving America's natural beauty for their descendants.\n\nSurely nobody could begrudge him if he left the details until later. He was, after all, the President."

 GLD.120.desc:0 "President Goldwater frowned as he sipped his coffee, hotter than the surface of Venus, just the way he liked it, though it was doing little for his mood. McNamara's proposal of what compromises and amendments to make to his initial plan for the Environmental Protection Agency lay on the desk, the object of his ire.\n\nMuch to his irritation, the President was forced to admit that McNamara's ideas would certainly be effective at pushing the EPA through Congress and establishing it with minimal blowback. Unfortunately, there was a price: major concessions to the same polluting industries that the EPA was being established to regulate. It was, in effect, a blunting of the teeth. A domestication, intended to hobble the EPA and prevent it from tackling the big dogs. Sure, it'd do some good, but the richest and thus most powerful offenders would get away virtually scot-free, with only a slap on the wrist for the future crimes against the environment they were sure to commit if McNamara's proposal shaped the EPA instead of his.\n\nGoldwater's pen hovered over the dotted line. If he signed, he'd be tarnishing one of his longest-held dreams, giving the polluters carte blanche to continue raping the natural world in exchange for agreeing to follow a handful of token restrictions. When he touched the pen to paper, he felt the familiar fiery indignation building in his chest. Would Michelangelo have knocked off David's head just to satisfy his critics?\n\nThe President faltered, torn. It'd be easy to sign and endorse McNamara's proposal, just a few strokes of the pen and he'd be able to avoid the anger of his voter base, and the party conservatives, and the business community. But, said that other little voice in his head, this is what you've been fighting for. Don't let them take it from you.\n\nDon't let the bastards win."

Addressing the nation had given him a bit of a thirst, and he resolved to get one of the girls in the typing pool to brew him up scorchingly hot coffee once he got back to the White House. He hoped the one with the blonde beehive hairdo would be there today. She knew just how he liked it.\n\nAlready the President was pondering what the public would make of his new bundle of policies aimed at increasing the prosperity of the National Parks program by expanding the size of many parks and drastically increasing their federal funding. He knew plenty of the Republicans and the progressives in the NPP would rail against what they saw as him taking money out of the hands of the poor and giving it to a gang of tree-huggers and mountain-climbers, but he knew, with just the slightest smile, that it wasn't too likely they'd be able to sway the public to their side.\n\nThe fact was that most Americans would be glad or at the very least ambivalent towards the good news that the National Parks would continue to be a major pillar in the preservation of America's environment. Of course, he'd need to find a way to actually, you know, pay for it, but that was something he could deal with later.\n\nFor now, filled with the lightness of being that comes with accomplishing a long-held goal, Goldwater rose and made a mental note to have every available newspaper praising his speech delivered to him as he made his way with his entourage back to Cadillac One."

It physically sickened him to read it, a nausea that soon settled and turned into a hard ball of cold fury he held in his stomach, burning away at him, tensing his every muscle.\n\nRockefeller sat opposite, his face growing more concerned by the second. Goldwater saw his Vice-President subconsciously draw back as he flicked his incandescently icy gaze on him. The air seemed to have been sucked from the room, the weight of what Goldwater had just read settling on him like an avalanche. Finally, bringing himself under control even as he felt that inflamed, boiling little ball in his stomach growing by the second, the President broke the tension.\n\n"So this is all of them," said the President. A statement, not a question. Rockefeller deflated with instant relief like a punctured balloon. "Yes, Mr. President. My aides and I have been working on this for some time now. This is every individual, business and governmental organization we have identified as being potential cohorts in a plan to subvert your environmental policies. As you can see, it contains members of Congress, local governments and members of the Fortune 500, including many individuals we have previously tagged as potentially engaging in corrupt activity."\n\nThe President just sat there, saying nothing, staring into the middle distance. Rockefeller gulped and, finding his courage, sallied forth. "Mr. President?"\n\nGoldwater's eyes snapped onto him. "Well Nelson," said the President, "I'd say we've got some work to do.""

In essence, the FECA regulates political fundraising and campaigning, and, among other things, it instituted legal limits on how much could be contributed to a political campaign. Hailed as a major blow against electoral corruption, the FECA was intended to level the playing field and root fraud from the political process.\n\nNevertheless, there will always be people willing to skirt the law if they think it'll get them what they want. Money makes the world go round, after all, and the marble halls of government are packed with those willing to have a few greenbacks stuffed in their back pocket.\n\nPresident Goldwater had been furious to discover businesses were working with politicians to subvert his environmental legislation, but his anger then was a pale comparison to the Hadean rage that burst from him when he was informed that major businesses had made illegal donations to pro-business, anti-environment politicians in exchange for votes. Lobbying is one thing, outright bribery is quite another.\n\nDriven by that ball of cold fury that burned within him, Goldwater decided to push the big red button and call out the corrupters and their lackeys who were so willing to undermine America's democratic traditions to continue unabated their plunder of the environment. And so, ever the believer in The System, he took them to court. Let's see how smug they are when the judge reads out their misdeeds for the whole nation to hear."

Nothing we can prosecute for, not yet, but there's a decent bit of evidence here suggesting there are more threads we can pull on. Which of these groups do you want us to go after?"\n\n"All of them."\n\n"Mr. President, we can't do a mass investigation of-"\n\n"Commissioner, I understand there are laws that need to be followed, but this situation demands extreme measures.

They are seditious revolutionaries who have no respect for the laws and customs of our nation, and would tear down the laws we're trying to enforce on them now. Start digging and you will find something."\n\nHalf an hour later, the commissioner left with a new plan of attack- three months of raids on far left and far right groups, and more to follow."

"Hey, now I haven't done anything-"\n\n"Mr. Belmont, I've got a warrant to search your home under Title I. of the Alien Registration Act, suspicion of subvers-"\n\n"Well, you can't come in. I haven't subverted a thing. And I'll be damned if I let some cronies of the Goldwater Jews come and ransack my-" His retort was cut off by Richards pushing by him. "This is a violation of the Bill of Rights, you thug! You'll get what you deserve!"\n\n"Search everywhere," said Richards, casually yanking out cushions from the couch and scattering them on the floor. "You never know where these rats like to hide things. You got anything you want to tell us about, Mr. Belmont?"\n\n"I'm not telling you a damn thing! How many shekels are they paying you pigs to turn on your own race?"\n\n"Not enough to deal with you," muttered Richards, tearing books from a shelf and shuffling through them before hurling them into the rapidly expanding clutter of the living room. "The National Renaissance Party's being run here, right? Out of your apartment? You really should clean up if you're having company over." Another book of esoterica joined the pile, and Richards pushed over the shelf for good measure.\n\nAn hour of searching later, the raiders departed leaving chaos and broken furniture in their wake. Nothing of interest had been found, which was disappointing, but who cared about the legal complaints of a few extremists? There was an SDS meeting to go break up at a nearby college."

A door creaking open, warm yellow light spilling into the stately hotel room, flowing over the richly upholstered couches and deep, plush bed. Shadow passing over the brief wedge of light. A silhouette slinks inside, closing the door behind him, careful not to make a noise. For a moment all is as it was before the shadowy figure's trespass. Still, silent, dark.\n\nA flashlight disguised as a ballpoint pen strikes, pointing a beam of dim blue light across the shag carpet. The man holding it slips out of his shoes and paces soundlessly across the carpet, anxious to finish his job quickly. He knows the impulse is absurd; the room's tenant being kept busy by a pair of dazzlingly beautiful women downstairs on the casino floor. Why do these fat, balding old men never get suspicious when centerfold girls half their age suddenly find them impossibly alluring?\n\nSupposing he shouldn't complain as it made his job a hell of a lot easier, he got to work. In the space of a few minutes, pen-light held in his mouth, he hid bugs all over the room and its ensuite bathroom, in the light fixtures, vents, closet, telephone. The secret meeting the room's tenant would be holding in the morning had, thanks to the Bureau's plants in his extremist group, remained secret for about ten minutes. Now they'd hear every word those fascist bastards said.\n\nThe agent smiled as he made his way back to the door. Like President Goldwater he was Jewish, and felt a certain righteousness in foiling the plans of Yockey's men. In bugged and wiretapped rooms all across America, Yockey and his supporters would be spilling their secrets to the Bureau. They'd be hard pressed to subvert democracy with Uncle Sam always knowing what they were up to. Taking a quick look around to make sure everything was as he'd left it, he slipped his shoes back on and slipped out the door, plunging the room once again into darkness."

Hard-faced and Quantico-fit, he fingered the revolver in his coat pocket, knowing it was only a matter of seconds until he caught his prey, panting and gasping like the obese hog he was.\n\nOh, he'd thought he was so clever. Unlike the rest of the dolts in the local chapter, the fat bastard had seen fit to question the man's sudden appearance at the weekly meetings. Far too clever for his own good, the pig had finally cornered him and uttered the words that would seal his fate. For once he'd been accused of being an FBI plant, the agent had no choice but to eliminate the swine, to keep his cover.\n\nDead end. His quarry spun around, beady little eyes barely visible through the fog. He began to beg for his life, but he was quickly cut off by a bullet to the brain. His corpulent body slumped to the rainwater-slick pavement, a thin line of blood slowly leaking out onto the concrete.\n\nThe agent spun at the sound of distant tires, startled at the appearance of a pair of headlights approaching out of the fog, staring him down like judging eyes. Shoving the revolver in his coat pocket, he clambered over a chain-link fence and skidded down a muddy slope to the street below, making his escape into a knot of twisting alleys.\n\nThe newspapers would call it a senseless murder, motiveless, no suspect. Used car salesman, father of three, devoted husband and pillar of the community. And, though it was not printed, Klokard of the local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan. With his death the agent's anonymity was safe, allowing him to continue reporting on their seditious behaviour, sifting for dirt to take them down.\n\nFor years to come, people walking that stretch of pavement would point the darkened bloodstain out to their friends, and wonder whose it had been."

The puddles covering the parking lot of the Philadelphia Sheraton Hotel, remnants of that morning's storm, glimmered like countless diamonds in the rays of sunlight poking through the clouds. Around him, three unmarked black cars screamed into the parking lot, disgorging a dozen hard-faced men in black suits. Crandall gave the signal, and they strode towards the hotel.\n\nTheir deep-cover boys in extremist groups had finally uncovered actionable intel on the greatest threat to the United States, the infamous fascist ideologue Francis Parker Yockey. After worming his way into Yockey's circle, an agent had reported to Quantico that Yockey always had with him a suitcase filled with forged passports with false identities; Mexican, Swedish, Australian, no doubt as insurance should he ever be forced to flee the country. Ironically, his attempt to escape the law had attracted them to him like a moth to a light. Before the day ended, Crandall would see the Nazi bastard in cuffs.\n\nCrandall and his boys marched across the Sheraton's opulent lobby, making no effort to wipe their feet. He flashed his badge at an irate desk clerk, and, without breaking his stride, flung open the doors to the convention hall where Yockey and his coterie were supposed to be hosting a fundraising event.\n\nInstantly he felt something was wrong. A hundred faces turned to him, but none of them were Yockey's. Gorge rising, his eyes groped for the sign proclaiming the name of the event: Christian Mothers for Teenage Abstinence. Swinging his gaze back to the conventioneers, he realized with a lurch of the stomach that they were middle-aged ladies one and all. Spluttering apologies, he slammed the doors behind him.\n\nThe bastard had flown the coop! Ignoring their shit-eating smirks, Crandall glanced over his men, wondering which of them was the snitch, then gruffly gave the order to return to the cars. They wouldn't get their man today. He was, Crandall reflected with irritation, probably already sipping a scotch and soda in an airplane bound for South America. Well, a man like Yockey wouldn't run forever.

Ignoring the simple beauty of nature around him, Donald made a beeline for his charcoal-stained old firepit. Without ceremony, he dumped the box among the ashes, squirted it with kerosene, and lit it with a thrown match. Tongues of fire reflected in his eyes, Donald watched the flames consume his robes, the dark green fabric of the Grand Dragon crumbling into ash.\n\nAlthough he told himself that what he did was out of simple pragmatism, Donald was afraid, a fear that would rule him for the rest of his days. He frowned as he stared into the flames.\n\nFollowing the radio's announcement that the Klan would be banned and its leaders arrested, a thousand similar scenes played out across America. In a single night, the power and organization of the Klan was decisively crushed by the President's agents, by methods of sometimes arguable legitimacy. Nevertheless, there was a change in the air. A new era was dawning, one in which black people could walk the streets without fear, their would-be tormentors hiding inside, peering with bloodshot eyes through the venetian blinds, forever wondering.\n\nWondering if today would be the day they got the call in the night."

All over the country, Yockey's web of shell corporations are being raided, his inner circle arrested on whatever charges we can reasonably expect a jury to believe, and membership in his political organizations made illegal. Although the man himself has vanished, presumably on his way to safe haven in Europe or South America on a phony passport, we've torn his power to shreds and, in doing so, we've excised the pulsing tumour at the nation's heart.\n\nThankfully, there has been little backlash to our persecution of the fascist fifth-columnists lurking within our society. Yockey has long been a stain on the NPP, and as much as they'd love to denounce us for attacking their party members, they can't do so without looking like they're endorsing his sick ideology. After all, Joe Citizen has little sympathy for fascism after the humiliations heaped upon us by Germany and Japan.\n\nEnjoying his morning coffee, President Goldwater allowed himself a moment of quiet triumph. He felt like the hero slaying the dragon in those old adventure tales he'd read as a kid, all those years ago in the hazy Arizona of his memory.

Our education system needs to focus more on the failures of Communism so that we could prevent any possibility for a socialist revolution in the future.\n\nThis latest Senate-approved bill will accomplish just this task.

Some newspapers were reluctant, while others began bizarre campaigns against the LNPP, with one local Utah paper calling all leftists "Communist Mutants From Space". Even the more moderate positions of the LNPP are coming under fire for "attempting to inject their awful beliefs into our pure American society".\n\nSince the inception of this campaign, any newspaper, regardless of the amount of readers, will be federally funded for any anti-Communist articles.

 GLD.271.desc:0 "For months, ever since Goldwater's suggestions for Cabinet first went to the Senate for confirmation, questions had been raised about Don Regan, the Secretary of the Treasury. A hardline conservative and strong believer in supply-side economics (better known by many as "trickle down theory"), Regan had long espoused ideas of stripping the federal government down to the bare minimum, which in his mind was basically maintaining an army, and staying as far away from telling anyone what to do.\n\nThe conflict came to a head early in Goldwater's Presidency, as discussion regarding cutting welfare spending and lowering taxes resulted in a heated debate between the President and VP Rockefeller, captured for posterity on the tape recordings that Goldwater had maintained in the Oval Office.\n\n"Mr. President, if you keep going down this route with Regan, you are going to destroy the economy, and the party," Rockefeller stated. "I know you are not in favor of regulations and such, but most of them are in place for a reason. We no longer poison people from what they eat, or injure them when they are building skyscrapers."\n\n"Don has shown me a lot of research that shows that if we get slackers off the dole, and let companies actually, you know, make stuff, that the whole economy will prosper," Goldwater replied, trying to keep a calm demeanor. "That will be enough to keep the R-Ds together."\n\n"Not if we are sending thousands of people into starvation!" Rockefeller yelled. "Are you willing to let that happen?""If it makes the country better off, then fuck them!" Goldwater bellowed. The argument went back and forth like this for half an hour, a clash of conservatism and liberalism, with tempers flaring and eventually Rockefeller put his foot down.\n\n"Mr. President, you have a choice. If you do what Regan is suggesting, you can kiss the Republican-Democrats goodbye. I know quite a few congresspeople that would rather work with the NPP than you. So, it's your choice to make." Seconds later, the door slammed, leaving Goldwater alone in the Oval Office.\n\n-excerpt from "Barry Goldwater: From Pilot to President" by Doris Kearns Goodwin"

Without once mentioning Goldwater's name, Harrington has picked apart, piece by piece, the whole domestic policy of the President, focusing especially on the budget cuts to welfare programs.\n\nWhile Goldwater has been attacked and criticized by many others for these same plans time and time again, they were barely pinpricks to the President.

"And I will assure them that the proposed budget will still make it possible for those that absolutely need the social safety net will receive it."\n\n"Our biggest focus is trying to ensure that federal finances will be sustainable for the long term. This means that some cuts will have to be made, and revenue increased. Welfare and tax reform will go a long way to solving both issues."\n\nThe President spent over half an hour answering questions that the reporters asked regarding costs, who would still qualify, and how the cuts will be implemented over the next few years. While there are many who are disappointed in the cuts, especially in the Republican faction of the R-Ds and members of C-NPP, early reports from pollsters indicate that many swing voters have been convinced by the President's speech.

I'm Walter Cronkite.\n\nWashington, D.C. is in turmoil and shock today with the presentation of President Goldwater's proposed budget to Congress. In a stunning move, many Senators from the President's own party stood up and left the Senate Chamber soon after the debate began on the budget.\n\nThe Republican faction of the R-Ds has been vocally opposed to the President's language and actions in the past few weeks in attempting to cut spending, especially on welfare programs. However, many senators are saying that it was even worse than they thought once they got the chance to read the budget, which led to the Republican Walkout today.\n\n"It is perfectly clear now who the President is supporting," one senator said to reporters as he left the Capitol Building. "And it isn't the average American, or those in dire need of help and assistance. All Goldwater is helping is his libertarian and arch-conservative allies, who want to run roughshod over the poor and struggling."\n\n"This isn't simply balancing the budget," another Senator remarked. "This is an outright declaration of war on the poor, the colored, and disabled. How can we even consider such a proposal without looking at the blood on our hands?"\n\nDemocrats have long supported cutting such spending, seeing it as wasteful, ineffective, leading to a larger government and reducing the liberty, freedom and work ethics of the American worker.\n\nThis may be a huge blow to President Goldwater. The Republican-Democrats, working together since the end of the World War, now seem to be on the verge of collapse, with the right-wing faction of the party gaining ascendance. But it remains to be seen if the budget that the President proposed will actually pass Congress."

However, many Americans are not going to immediately exchange their bills for gold coins, but there is a confidence amongst everyone that if they want to, they can.\n\nWith the confidence of gold backing up the US dollars, and the measures we put in place to keep prices stable and reasonable, we should soon be seeing inflation level off and businesses profits increase.

Those that are not getting the gold or silver are now sure they are being swindled, and banks are on the verge of collapsing. Not only that, but our efforts to set price limits on goods to prevent inflation has also backfired: most of the goods we sought to restrict are now being sold for much more than we decreed, and many stores are being overwhelmed as panicked shoppers try to stock up on everything from canned foods to toilet paper.\n\nNeedless to say, this has been perhaps the worst thing to happen to our economy since the Great Depression. Already many businesses are facing a credit crunch, and layoffs are soon to be widespread. Republican-Democrats in Washington are unable to work together, with liberals blaming conservatives for their misguided actions, and conservatives are accusing liberals of sabotage.

Surprisingly, the all-American corn-fed football-playing beer-drinking Maryland cop turned out to be as red as cherry pie due to his upbringing, raised in an odd socialist commune by a pair of avowed leftists.\n\nThanks to Tarrant recently becoming a household name, his public endorsement of Hall has had the same effect for the usually obscure leftist faction of the NPP, catapulting them and Hall to the forefront of the public's attention. To Goldwater's consternation, he'd already heard whispers about Hall using the momentum from Tarrant's endorsement stand for the NPP's nomination in 1972.\n\nIrritating that a single nobody could have this much impact, thought the President. If it wasn't for that photographer being in the right place at the right time, Tarrant would still be just another Joe Schlub and Hall would still be an obscure nobody. Sipping his coffee, the President wondered what to do about the situation. He could put an end to their little commie propaganda campaign, but it might look like a restriction of free speech. Alternatively, he could just ignore it and let them have their poster-boy. No doubt they'd run out of steam soon enough."

He didn't mind a bit of conversation, but couldn't Teddy let him savour his lunch in peace?\n\n"Remember that cop had the shootout with the Nazis in Baltimore, was in the news a while back? President's sayin' he's a commie or somethin', says he oughta get taken off the force."\n\n"What's wrong with killing a fuckin' Nazi?" said Frank through a mouthful of prosciutto. "You ask me, I'd rather have that cop in the White House than that Arizona Jew. Shit, you know I ain't no commie, but what's the goddamn problem? Ain't he got the right to say whatever he wants?"\n\n"No argument here," replied Teddy, finishing his coffee. "This is America. So what if the cop's red as a baboon's ass? He's out there killing Nazis while the President does jack-shit. Hey, I'll see you back at the office, Gunderson's breaking my back over the Pepsi account."\n\nFrank grunted goodbye and picked up Teddy's paper to entertain himself as he finished his lunch.

Several days have passed since the inauguration of America's most recent President. Barry Goldwater gathered his notes together and faced the restless crowd as he began one of his first speeches as President of the United States. Today's speech consisted of his plan to improve the economy, invest in the defenses of the OFN, and handle America's foreign policy. However, as the former Arizona senator dragged on, his words began to target specific parties in the United States.\n\n"I've encountered plenty of 'bad apples' in the political system of our country, but I have never seen a party more destructive to our way of life than the LNPP. You can't find a good politician in the group, they're all bad! And they want to introduce harsh civil rights policies that would change the country all too quickly! These guys preach the nationalization of every business in America, obviously they want to crack down on individuality! They even want to expand welfare far beyond what we're capable of right now! I don't believe a single 'true' American would support their policies!"\n\nOnce the President finished his speech and began the trip back to Washington, he received a phonie call from his Vice President Nelson Rockefeller. "Barry, did you not hear yourself up there?!" the VP exclaimed, "I hope you remembered that our party is advocating for the same principles you just denounced. Not only are you slinging mud on your own party for no reason, but you were targeting your fellow Americans today.

 GLD.union.1.desc:0 "For much of his near-sixty years of life, President Barry Goldwater had maintained one routine without ever skipping a day. At around six in the morning he would wake up, make for the kitchen, and prepare himself a cup of coffee. Larger, more staffed and more stocked his new DC abode may be -- but the ingredients and proportions in use hadn't changed from his shack in Paradise Valley.\n\nThe Arizonan's recipe of choice was simple: Two sugar, one cream, no milk, five ounces of water -- just enough to keep the slightly sweet taste potent. He wouldn't trade it for any other mix in the world. If someone else prefers their coffee with more or less sugar and creamer then that was fine too. Any self-respecting man would tailor their coffee to their own unique tastes instead of letting someone else decide the flavor for them.\n\nBarry smiled to himself. It seemed fitting that centuries-old, future-proof wisdoms can be gleaned through the simple act of preparing Earth's black blood. But what did it say when half the country still acted as if they only drank instant coffee their whole lives? That wouldn't do at all.\n\nAs he stirred his mug with a teaspoon, Barry thought of the future. The country has no shortage of troublemakers who'd love nothing more than to herd the American people along like unthinking sheep. Strays from the flock, dreaming of the freedom they deserve, would be brought back by gentle-looking hands to await the inevitable slaughter. Plenty of those in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, banners red like the blood of lambs. In his weaker moments the desire to fight evil with a lesser evil grows strong... but it was far too early to make such a drastic decision.\n\nAmerica's new President took his first sip for the morning. He promised every American would have the chance to brew their own coffee. Can't do that without starting the day right, now can he?"

It had caused a minor scandal in the leadup, but was soon forgotten after his victory. Barry suspected that these deals had become far too commonplace for the Midwest's politicians to garner their concern. The statesmen of Congress are no less vulnerable to pecuniary concerns than the working man, after all -- what was a little quid-pro-quo with the local union for some pocket change?\n\nNaturally, any man of principle would feel incensed at such blatant corruption. The Arizonan himself was reminded too much of New York and old Tammany Hall -- a well-oiled machine of bribes, favors and ballot boxes -- for comfort.\n\nAnd so it was that he said just as much to Don in a private lunch, to which the Secretary of the Treasury replied shruggingly:"

At best it's a questionable, dubious attempt to hold the nation's labor leaders accountable. At worst..."\n\nThe Republican Vice President held a glare at his Democrat colleague. "It's a blatant smear job," he said sotto voce.\n\nRed-faced, Secretary Regan began to burst a reply-\n\n"Gentlemen."\n\n-were it not for President Barry Goldwater's sharp rebuke.

He let it linger on his Vice President a fraction of a moment more. "Need I remind you both again to settle your differences like adults, and not like schoolchildren?"\n\nChastised, Regan returned to skimming the portfolio with a grimace. Rockefeller returned the President's stare, before sighing. "Yes, Mister President."\n\nGoldwater nodded.

Up until now he said nothing, only scanning the names and details on the briefing like a hawk appraising helpless worms writhing above ground.

Edgar Hoover's following statement verbatim, 'bring these frauds to heel'. Can you elaborate?"\n\nBarry gave himself a thin-lipped moment to ponder an answer. Frauds, eh? Very apt. With a breath he edged closer to the microphone and said, "Unfortunately, I am not at liberty to release the details of an ongoing federal investigation. But know this: Corruption undermines both the integrity of the government's laws and its people's trust therein."\n\nHe soothed his parched throat with a gulp of bottled water. "If these... frauds, as Director Hoover describes them," the President continued, "were proven to have used their subordinates' money to enrich themselves and their political allies, rather than to better their workers' lot, then I will not hesitate to wield all the implements the Constitution has bestowed upon my office to see these men answer to the Blind Lady in court."\n\nA nod from the journalist as she sat down.

Companies, friendships, even governments aren't immune to this ugly manifestation of human nature -- Barry needed to glance only once at the muck and grime in Capitol Hill he'd seen since his tenure as Senator to impress that immutable fact into his head.\n\nLabor unions are no different, else why would so many millions flock under their cogs and hammers and sickles? Their playbook is a masterstroke in both its simplicity and its grasp of men's inner machinations: Workers join a union and get all these wonderful benefits, but not before coughing up their cash every now and then and pledging their fealty. Just like that, John Doe gets conned out of both his savings and his free will, tempted by the money to hedge their bets on collective fraud disguised as the highway to a wonderful career. For the rudely awakened... Well, peer pressure and the threat of exile do just fine keeping these comrades in line. Meanwhile, their bosses are free to do whatever they will with countless millions in ill-gotten paychecks. Despicable and abhorrent, but successful all the same.\n\nThis time the roast on Barry's mug was strong and potent, scalding, bitter. It roiled and burbled on his tongue as he read one of several thousand tragedies the White House's mailbox had received since he announced his war on union corruption. After reaching the last dot, he tossed the letter aside and scratched another missive to Director Hoover.\n\nSomething had to be done before these duplicitous "vanguards of workers' rights" swindle another hardworking American.

If they refuse, a shakedown that escalates in a span of weeks until they acquiesce or leave. So-called "scabs" have no place with the boys, after all; more importantly, bosses love to see their numbers grow.\n\nWhat happened afterwards resembled more of a protection racket than a confraternity of workers. Aforementioned benefits were "delayed" due to supposed problems with their employer, all while payments were leaving their owners for their boss's pockets. The unions stifled all attempts to speak out against such cases of unfair treatment, either with community conformity or with brute thugs masquerading as their "comrades" glowering behind every eye corner.\n\nLeft with no other recourse, these men took the federal government's hand, no matter how questionable its presence, if it meant the chance to sterilize these reservoirs of corruption from top to bottom..."

Its title succinctly summarized its contents: Extensive restrictions on the how's and what's of union recruitment practices. Maybe then, its authors hoped, unions will be compelled to comport themselves to the image they promote... and show the American people how spectacularly they fail at practicing what they preach.\n\nNaturally, the now-named Union Recruitment Standards Act was received just as partisanly as it was written. Democrats bellowed their assent, Republicans muttered their approval, over half the National Progressives screeched their opprobrium, and the rest broke ranks and hollered their "commitment to beloved principle". America fell in line with their Congressmen soon after; needless to say, its discourse over the proposed legislation violently reflected the animus that had settled in Congress like miasmatic vapor since the Second World War.\n\nBut there is nothing else both its supporters and detractors can do, now that the bill has entered judgement by Capitol Hill. The Ayes and Nays have been courted, arms twisted, favors owed and hands shaked.

At least there was consensus on who first to deal with -- that onerous honor belonged to the Senators sympathetic to the trade unionists' cause. Where American compromise stumbled was in these Senators' party affiliations.\n\nIn this issue his allies are split into two roughly even camps. The first he calls the Partisans, so named for their visceral hatred for the cretins in the NPP. One can even say their willingness to toss the opposition into the howling wilderness supersedes their commitment to ending corruption in politics, adamant as they are in ensuring that the campaign focus only on the leftists and progressives among the NPP's ranks. Nevertheless, they do raise some good points; chief among them is the fact that, should their strategy be undertaken fully, the NPP will leave this mess a shattered pot money can no longer repair.\n\nThe other side of the conversation is the Idealists: Noble men who rallied around the President's clarion call against the socialist menace and of their own volition. They suggest that the sword of justice fall equally onto both parties, else the people would see the campaign only as an act of hypocrisy. Notable in their rhetoric are suggestions that the Republicans share their adversaries' fate -- after all, have the Senators of New England and the Midwest not received their share of the red-tainted spoils as well?\n\nWhatever President Goldwater chooses will decide the course of his campaign hence.

 GLD.union.17.desc:0 "As one would expect of a civil case judging the fate of a union with millions of members throughout the country, its proceedings have been charged, tense, and barely civil.\n\nViolence almost erupted as soon as both plaintiff and attendant delivered their opening statements, when an attorney made offensive remarks against a union boss's character. Internal security within the courtroom had run itself ragged keeping its participants from speaking out of line and protestors from interfering with the proceedings itself. Although arguments were kept from devolving into bloody fistfights, if only just, the entire trial simmered with a consistent level of snide and creative insults exchanged between government and union throughout.\n\nNot that insults were all both sides could offer, of course. The Justices had their fill of evidence and testimony as well: Laws, prior court decisions, compromising materials, even emotional outbursts from several witnesses. Each side did whatever they could to convince the law of the other's guilt, if not their own innocence.\n\nBut there were only so many hours in a day, and everyone involved expected a speedy trial. Weeks later, America's most esteemed judges convened behind the court's closed doors to agree upon the AFL-CIO's fate."

 GLD.union.18.desc:0 "Barry Goldwater was no stranger to loss. He'd lost elections before, lost friends alive and dead, lost everything between a couple dimes and several millions of donor and party dollars. But he thought himself tough, that there's always next times lying in wait just ready to be caught with fresher hands, new opportunities to get what he wants where he wants it.\n\nHis copy of The Washington Times, just a few hours old, had crumples and tear notches with how tight his shaking fists latched onto its margins. In front page, bold text:\n\n"SUPREME COURT RULES 7-2 AGAINST PRES. GOLDWATER"\n\nThere was no getting out of this loss, that much he knew.\n\nWith a wordless cry he threw the crumpled newspaper aside. A hand reached out for a mug of coffee on the Resolute Desk, only to find no purchase. Right, he'd thrown that too, hadn't he? Now it was just fragments of wet, sticky ceramic on the marble floor. Hit the bird splayed at the center of the Oval Office square in the eye too. Cleaning staff can take care of the mess.\n\nSighing, he rose up and hobbled towards the windowpane. Warm and sunny outside, like the good Lord couldn't give a rat's ass about his loss. What did he do to earn His disfavor? Doing the good thing? Something to think about while he spends the rest of his term making like a crippled goose, then.\n\nUnbidden, the old verse from the Book of Psalms left his lips:"

 GLD.union.19.desc:0 "Steam rose as faint wisps from the warm mug that had kept Barry Goldwater company this Oval Office midnight, same as the last. He took a small sample of minutes-old coffee, wincing at the acrid taste as he set the mug onto its plate. Pure black's never easy to get used to, even after drinking nothing but it for days.\n\nBut it was easy to lash out when he heard the news. Lash out at his fellow Americans for not backing him to the hilt. Lash out at the Justices for letting the union bastards get off scot-free. Lash out at God for not sending him a miracle at the end of so much effort. Hatred was strong and raw then, so very tempting to wield.\n\nThankfully, reason quickly reasserted itself. He had his victories, the unions have theirs. He may not have brought the whole thing down, but neither had they gotten away without a nasty limp. He still has half of America on his side, and a good chunk of Congress to boot. His campaign's wounded and bleeding -- but it's not yet out. Never out, if he had his way.\n\nAnd so it was that he addressed his Cabinet later in the day, thanking them for the work they were putting to bring the unions down. They needed reassurance after seeing them "come to naught" against the AFL-CIO. No matter, he said, there's still everyone else. If not America's biggest union, then the bottom feeders nibbling at the scraps it leaves behind.\n\nHoover got a different message shortly after, in yet another of their "personal conversations" behind closed doors."

Sweeter than his standard fare; then again, today was nothing standard either.\n\nGlancing across the table, Barry saw the Director's poison-laced stare bore holes at today's issue of The Washington Times. Its front page had a still of the Supreme Court immediately after the vote, captioned "SC VOTES 5-4 TO CUT AFL-CIO DOWN" underneath. The President felt his grin grow wider.\n\nSure, the union bastards got away in the end. But they also left behind a waterfall of blood as they shambled away to wherever dark crevasse they'd come from. He took another sip from his mug -- slightly bitter, just the right amount of sweet. He can live with a flavor like that.\n\n"What do you mean, Speed?" the President inquired. "We'll do what we've been doing ever since I made the Oval Office my bedroom."\n\n"The Court didn't do enough. Who's to say they won't get back up again?" The Director swigged half his coffee in one gulp, before setting it aside.\n\n"With the penalties coming their way, and the other laws besides? They'll be lucky to make it past the end of the century." Barry continued, "The message got across, that's what matters. We'll come for the rest of them soon enough.""

This time he added twice the sugar and thrice the cream to the mug, before pouring boiling water to mix. Hot mocha seemed appropriate for starting a very promising day -- a little treat every now and then never hurt anybody.\n\nHe had every reason to treat himself, really. If bringing down the fattest socialist hydra in America didn't at least deserve a sugar rush on his part, then why bother celebrating anything at all?\n\nLast night's celebrations still struck vivid images in his mind. Good cheers rang throughout the White House as rich vintages, reserved only for special occasions, flowed the length of its hallways like life-giving rivers. His staff unstuck themselves from that one moment of disbelief upon hearing the decision by hugging and kissing each other as if Christmas Eve and New Years put together had come. He joined in of course. If the kids can have their fun, then so can this old timer with all the stress to burn.\n\nBarry allowed himself a gulp of rich, creamy hot mocha. Of course there'd be fallout; he heard fallout shouting and chanting slogans even from the comfort of his kitchen, sounding like gouts of fire sweeping a crackling inferno across DC. He can start putting fires out after getting prepared for another day in the White House. But for now?\n\nThe President downed the rest of his coffee with one flick of the wrist. Sweet, sweet victory."

Some rights have to be waived, its proponents argue, in order to fashion a weapon to banish greater evils.

Everyone has their skeletons, after all, least of all large organizations with the money and pull to draw America's hard workers by the millions. The action was of little surprise for President Goldwater's close council -- his legendary antipathy for "bloated rackets led by the most corrupt of men" was well-known within the Beltway and beyond. Director Hoover assuaged concerns of a slip-up escalating into a scandal rivalling the Nixon debacle, saying that his men are, to quote verbatim, "...competent enough not to get caught by some reds and rent-a-cops. His agents will get away with the dirt without leaving a fingerprint."\n\nSo far, the Director's words ring true. After mere days of planning and observation, a clandestine break-in of an office building evinced the corruption President Goldwater railed against: gifts to fellow union bosses, membership fees "creatively deducted" from annual earnings reports, officers buying twice what they make in a month. The subsequent leak to the media from a "concerned insider" made certain of the union's demise from both public shame and public lawsuits."

 GLD.union.102.desc:0 "By now enough facts have been painstakingly filtered out of the ongoing chaos to piece together a brief account of the incident that had occurred in Washington, D.C. None of them bode well for Goldwater.\n\nIt began, according to testimony, when a guard working the night shift in the American Federation of Teachers building at New Jersey Avenue spotted unusual lights coming from one of the fifth floor facade windows. The nine-story compound had already closed for the day hours earlier; that the lights seemed to flicker from spot to spot roused the guard's suspicion that thieves had broken in. Entering with a spare key, he climbed the stairs hoping to apprehend them before they accost with stolen valuables.\n\nWhat followed was a scuffle with no less than three persons, fully clad in black from head to toe. Surprisingly the guard only received minor cuts and bruises from the group, who had suddenly fled after knocking him to the ground. Why they didn't bother checking if he was conscious remains a mystery, but it was one that proved to benefit the disheveled officer as he inspected what they had left behind.\n\nPapers covered the desks and floor, scattered haystrewn across the office. Drawers gaped open, now emptier without their paper -- but their more valuable effects were left virtually untouched. Cubicle after cubicle of upended folders and undisturbed paper bills. By now the guard was befuddled and confused; just what were the thieves looking for?\n\nAfter switching the lights on, however, he then noticed gold glimmering half-beneath the sea of crisp, white letter paper. Brushing aside the sheafs, he picked it up.\n\nThus, at 1:13 in the early morning, the Metropolitan Police Department woke up to a security guard with an FBI badge held by a shaky vice grip. Thirty minutes later, every news station in the country woke up to an MPD statement that said FBI agents unlawfully entered the AFL compound at midnight. Five hours later, two hundred million Americans woke up to headlines, in bold, flashing print, that said the FBI had burgled a labor union."

The President enjoyed a sip as he sat down.\n\n"Flight was much more peaceful than the ride to LAX," replied Ronald Reagan opposite his side of the table. "Hollywood's been up in arms since the elections and I haven't had a day of peace and quiet since."\n\nIn one motion he took a swig off the other mug. The actor had his taste and waited for nothing to get it. That alone was worth Barry's respect -- which wasn't hard to acquire for a man of Mr. Reagan's character. The Arizonan had already owed him much more than that when he supported his candidacy last Convention with the finest speech he'd ever heard from a Californian.\n\n"I can imagine." Barry gulped another helping of coffee, before continuing. "Your fellow actors tied their feet to the hawk's?"\n\nReagan smiled knowingly. "You can say that."\n\nTrust Hollywood to vote for anyone without a D next to their names. Yet another of many gripes the President has with the city's teeming liberals.

Cue a trickle of workers slotting their punch cards by the factory entrance, school children entering the bus in front of their house.

A group of teenagers have their hands uncuffed before a police cruiser takes them home. Outside an emergency room, an EMT weeps as doctors carry a body bag to the mortuary. The soothing bass voiceover continues that some people wish America to stay in its long nightmare instead of moving on.\n\nThe ad ends with pair of soldiers hoisting Old Glory to the top of a flagpole, fluttering against the bright morning sun, the blue morning sky, and the gentle morning breeze.

He'd learned to choose his words carefully when the topic is broached; in this case, the only sensible decision was to say nothing at all.\n\n"Seriously," Rosie grumbled, "what good's those degrees of hers if she can't tell facts from all the horse dung in Gramps's farm?

But his friend had a welcoming sense of humor, he thought happily, if the titters that left her lips said anything. Seconds later, they evolved into stomach-aching chortles that echoed through the waiting lobby and caught the attention of the handful early arrivals mulling about.\n\nRosie's laughter drew in their nods and smirks -- not at her, for some reason, but at James instead.

Finally, he responded: "Get me Schmidt. Tell him to stop whatever he's doing and come here at once." At this command, the orderly gave him a quick salute and departed the office immediately.\n\nA furrowed brow was the only indication of the fury building within Speer's heart. After all his valiant effort towards detente with the Americans, this new president was simply about to throw it away to satisfy the whims of his electorate. He stood, pacing towards the window to calm his mind. Beyond the glass, Germania still bore the scars of the war. Trade was the lifeblood of nations, and without it a wounded nation like Germany would struggle to pull itself up from the ashes.\n\nA few moments passed before Helmut Schmidt strode briskly into the office. The concerned look on his face as he saluted indicated that he was clearly already aware of the situation. "You asked to see me, my Führer?"\n\n"The Americans have restored the embargo. I want you to contact their government and ask them... no, you are going to tell them that we will talk this out. I will not allow our efforts to normalize relations be in vain."

 GLD.Speer.2.desc:0 "Robert McNamara had taken a break for lunch when his secretary barged in, informing him that German Foreign Minister Helmut Schmidt was on the phone. He supposed it was only a matter of time before they came protesting about the embargo, though he wished it had not come during his brief respite.\n\nHelmut Schmidt was a curious character. Despite his nation's poor diplomatic reputation, the man seemingly oozed a calm sort of confidence. Irrespective of the animosity between their nations, Schmidt was cordial as he spoke at length with McNamara.\n\n"Mr. McNamara, speaking on behalf of Führer Albert Speer and the Greater German Reich, I implore your government to reconsider this course of action. There is much benefit to be had from trade between our two great nations, I'm sure you understand. I am willing to personally travel to negotiate with your president, in the interests of normalizing diplomatic relations once again."\n\nWithin hours of this phone call, McNamara sat in the Oval Office, recounting the discussion to President Goldwater. "The Germans seem willing to parley with us, but the American public expects us to uphold our promises and stop trade with the fascists," McNamara concluded. "I told him I would call him back with your response shortly. What do you want me to say, Mr. President?"\n\nGoldwater thought for a moment. It was certain that America held the upper hand. Perhaps if he met with this Schmidt, he could twist the Germans' arm and get them to make some major concessions in exchange for a more lenient policy. Done well, he could really show the world that America was undisputedly a superior power to Germany. On the other hand, simply telling the Germans that no means no would be a firm statement in its own right, and stonewalling them would reinforce his voters' faith in his commitment to shutting off the fascist powers.\n\nAfter a discussion with his advisors, Goldwater turned once more to McNamarra.

German businesses in the OFN were rapidly shuttering, and some Reich owned cargo ships had reportedly made a hasty retreat from American ports for fear of being arrested or even fired upon.\n\nAfter the two men exchanged some words, Schmidt left Speer to go and fetch the advisors for a meeting. Once more, Speer found himself glancing out the window at the scarred cityscape of Germania, wondering what more could be done. If he faltered here, this loss of prestige could prove damaging to his already tenuous leadership of the Reich.\n\n"The Americans aren't taking us seriously." He pondered to himself for a moment. It was then he had an idea. It was unprecedented and downright improbable, but he had to try. "They will not take Germany seriously, but perhaps they will take me seriously."\n\nHalf an hour later, Speer sat with Schmidt and several adivsors to discuss the situation. Amidst the chaotic chatter and contingency planning, Speer spoke up suddenly. "Perhaps the Americans will listen if I talk directly to them."\n\nThere was silence at the table. "Pardon, my Führer?" asked Schmidt, incredulity barely concealed.\n\nSpeer gazed back at him, a determined look in his eye. "We can arrange a meeting. In neutral territory; perhaps Switzerland?

I spoke directly with Mr. Speer on the phone, and he is insistent that he is willing to personally negotiate this."\n\nAcross the desk from McNamarra, President Goldwater sat back in his chair. This was certainly unprecedented. Barring the brief period of the embargo being lifted, relations between America and Nazi Germany had been cold at best, and their heads of state had never met directly. He stroked his chin for a moment as he considered the implications.\n\n"Where would we even meet? I doubt he'd be willing to come to America, and I'm not stepping foot in that cursed country."\n\n"He has proposed that you meet him in Geneva. The Swiss are leery of the Germans at the best of times, but they're willing to offer us neutral ground to meet."\n\nSo the man has clearly given thought to this, thought Goldwater. At first, he almost laughed. It was absurd, and quite frankly reeked of desperation to overturn the embargo. What was he supposed to do? Fly to Geneva, tell Speer 'no' and then fly back home?\n\nAnd yet as he thought on it, that alone almost sounded like a golden opportunity. As he had already remarked, the Germans were desperate; America had the upper hand here. To go to Geneva, meet the Führer face to face, and then before all the world tell the leader of the so-called "master race" where to shove it?\n\nGoldwater would be an American hero overnight.\n\nIt was still perhaps a simply unnecessary exercise, and he still had half a mind to refuse outright. But perhaps this was the optimal moment to show the Germans who was boss. After all, it was unlikely a despot like Speer was likely to change Goldwater's mind on anything."

He had expected this, of course, but it was nonetheless disappointing. And humiliating. "I understand. Thank you for letting me know, Schmidt. You can leave now." Schmidt gave a final salute and an apologetic look before he turned and left the office.\n\nSpeer sat quietly at the desk and ruminated on this defeat snatched from victory. He had been close, so close, to repairing relations between two of the world's foremost superpowers. Alas, thanks to the whims of American democracy and stubborn American pride, Germany was back at square one. The loss of prosperity to both nations would be significant, but undoubtedly it would be Germany, cast in the role of pariah once more, that took the greater hit to its prestige.\n\nThe Führer sighed heartily. He supposed there was little to be done. The Americans had made their choice, and perhaps four, eight or however many years from now they would change their minds. For now, all he could do was lead as he did before. Pacing once more to the window and looking out at the city, he resigned himself to the hope that the people would struggle on regardless. The German nation was strong, and there were other partners to be made in this wide world. Germany would have to pull itself from the ashes without reliance on America or any other nation, just as it had done once before."

His long shot plan had worked. A moment passed as Speer collected his racing thoughts. Finally he stood, almost too quickly, and motioned for Schmidt to follow him as he marched from the office. "Cancel my appointments for the week," he instructed his secretary as he passed, "and have someone pack my travel essentials."\n\nStriding further ahead, Speer had an almost manic energy in his step as he conversed with Schmidt. "We have much to prepare. This meeting is crucial for the future of our relations and for Germany's place in the world. Goldwater will almost certainly be playing from a position of strength and, well, I must confess I am no diplomat.\n\nSchmidt struggled to keep up. "I understand, my Führer. I will help wherever I can. If you like, I can help you practice the negotiations."\n\n"I would much appreciate that. I will need all the help I can get." Pausing in the hallway, he turned to Schmidt and took him by the arm.\n\n"This is a historic moment. We must not let it go to waste.""

 GLD.Speer.7.t:0 "Two Worlds Collide"
 GLD.Speer.7.desc:0 "Packing, preparing and flying out to Geneva took less than two days, such was the expediency of the federal branch for such an important occasion. As the plane approached landing, the Secret Service agents aboard began hurriedly running through procedure one more time, and for the first time President Goldwater began to grow nervous. Pushing back the more ridiculous scenarios like this being some harebrained German plot to assassinate him to the back of his mind, Goldwater himself began mentally preparing himself for the meeting.\n\nThe Swiss capital was undoubtedly beautiful, and sizable crowds had gathered to watch as his armored motorcade passed through. As he approached the designated meeting point, Goldwater wondered what Speer himself would be like. He had seen some footage of Speer speaking, in the aftermath of the German Civil War and several times since, and while he certainly seemed to be less of a firebrand than Adolf Hitler had been in his heyday, he was still most definitely a Nazi. Speer would almost certainly be speaking from a position of deluded superiority, which might make talking to him more difficult.\n\n"It will at least make putting him in his place all the more sweet," he remarked to no-one in particular.\n\nThe scene outside of the hotel was intense as his car pulled up. Several Secret Service agents had gone ahead and secured the hotel, while some of Speer's bodyguards had done the same. The two groups regarded each other with a mixture of cold contempt and silent curiosity, but both maintained their distance and followed protocol. As Goldwater stepped out of the vehicle, another car pulled around the corner and parked a short distance from his. And out from the car, wearing a plain grey suit marred only by the armband of the swastika, was the Führer himself.\n\nThe two men stared at each other for a moment. Goldwater expected him to give some long winded remark about the pride of the German nation and then greet him with a Nazi salute. Instead, Speer stepped forwards with a slight smile, reached out his hand and greeted him, in English.\n\n"Good afternoon to you, Mr. Goldwater.""

 GLD.Speer.8.t:0 "A Meeting in Geneva"
 GLD.Speer.8.desc:0 "The American President Goldwater had arrived at the hotel shortly before Speer himself. Speer had debated what to do upon meeting him, considering a quick salute and a bow of acknowledgement, but Schmidt had argued that a simple handshake and a greeting in English would be more diplomatic. And so the two had shaken hands, being immortalized in an image likely by now already circling through the world's media. The two entered a reserved hotel room along with their respective translators, with their security details waiting outside the doors.\n\nThe world leaders were tense as they sat opposite each other. They danced around the subject at hand for a while. "How was your flight, Mr. Goldwater?" asked Speer.\n\n"Pleasant," replied Goldwater tersely, before pausing for a while. "I understand that the reconstruction of your country is going well?"\n\n"Indeed, indeed." As the small talk wore on, Speer knew that they would soon have to face the subject at hand. He thought back to the angles that he had discussed with Schmidt, and weighed up his options. He could try to address Goldwater's concerns about Germany's past, using his reforms as proof that Germany had changed enough to appease the Americans' sense of righteousness. Alternatively, he could push for Goldwater to consider allowing his allied nations to sidestep the embargo in the interests of free trade, allowing Germany to retain some of its business ties there. Finally, if all else failed, he could resort to flattery to appeal to the famous American ego.\n\nA silence had begun to build between them. Speer knew he had to say something, or else Goldwater would surely grow bored and leave."

 GLD.Speer.9.desc:0 "After the clicking of the press cameras and the heavy footfalls of their combined security entourage had faded away, Goldwater and Speer now found themselves alone (barring their respective translators) in the designated hotel room, with their security details waiting outside. The two men sat together at a table. Several attempts at conversation were made, though the language barrier and the latent tension of the situation made the initial smalltalk rather stilted. Goldwater was beginning to consider whether this had truly been a waste of time, before Speer's face became set with determination and he began to speak in earnest.\n\n"I will confess to you, Mr. Goldwater, that my nation has made many... misjudgements in its past. We allowed renegade groups such as the SS, and power hungry men like Bormann and Goering to wield power, and in doing so allowed terrible acts to be committed in our Fatherland's name. Understand that the Germany I rule over now is not the Germany of yesteryear. I can assure you that all we desire is peace, trade and brotherhood with the nations of the world." Goldwater listened as Speer's translator relayed this spiel to him, noting the translator's clear shock and discomfort at Speer's denunciation of his regime's past actions.\n\nIn spite of himself, Goldwater felt a rush of fury. Speer sounded sincere, but he was being careful. Careful not to implicate himself, or his dear late Hitler. Careful to lay the blame on his enemies, absolving himself of any part in the crimes of his despicable regime. Careful to present himself not as a snivelling minion of evil but a blameless savior. If ever there was a time to denounce Speer as the monster he was and make his bold exit, now was that time.\n\nAnd yet perhaps he could work with this. Speer wanted to present himself as a reformer; maybe it was time to make him put his money where his mouth was. He could offer Speer the trade he so dearly wanted, but only if he agreed to end Nazism, allow free elections, decolonize Europe, free the slaves and abolish his oversized military. If he refused (which he obviously would), then all the world would see what a hypocrite the Führer was.\n\nGoldwater allowed himself a moment's pause before he spoke."

I can assure you that all we desire is peace, trade and brotherhood with the nations of the world."\n\nSpeer waited as his translator relayed his words to the President. He noted two things. The first was the look of clear shock in his translator's eyes at the words he was made to say. He supposed it was only natural - the man had been brought up to love his Fatherland unconditionally, so acknowledging its faults must feel like finding out a dark family secret. The second thing was Goldwater's reaction. The President was silent for a moment, but a brief flash of anger appeared in his expression. This was quickly replaced by what could only be a look of cunning, and Speer braced himself for what he was about to say.\n\n"It is true that you have done much to reform your country, but I question how much of what you say is genuine. You say you are a reformer, Herr Speer? If what you say is true, then perhaps you will stand down? Allow the German people free and fair democratic elections and open up your economic sphere to the world. Perhaps then I would be willing to allow trade with Germany."\n\nSpeer stared for a moment, dumbstruck. Was this some attempt at American humor? He had made the effort to reach out, and now the American mocked him with such unreasonable demands! He was almost tempted to storm out immediately, but his thoughts caught on something. Specifically, Goldwater's insistence that Germany open its economic sphere to America. Was this not a little hypocritical, given Goldwater's strict missive to his allied nations to cease trade with Germany? Perhaps he could capitalize on this contradiction... or he could leave the arrogant American to his delusions."

Goldwater actually had to suppress a laugh. He had caught Speer out on his hypocrisy, and as soon as he got back to America he would regale the press with how the Führer sputtered and stumbled and came up with a thousand excuses for the continuation of his regime. He could already picture the headlines, the documentaries, the inevitable historical significance of -\n\nSpeer laughed. Not a laugh of nervousness or fear, but of amusement. Speer began speaking, his brow cocked slightly as he spoke, and Goldwater found himself suddenly on edge as he awaited the translation.\n\n"You are clearly committed to your ideals of democracy, Mr. Goldwater. Or are you? I notice that you insist upon principles of free trade, and yet in your embargo you expressly forbid nations under the American alliance from trading with Germany. This is somewhat hypocritical, no? Especially for an alliance known as the Organization of 'Free' Nations. Perhaps if you wish to talk of openness, you should start by allowing the many great nations under the American wing to trade with whoever they please."\n\nGoldwater started. Then he stopped. And started and stopped again. He tried to think of a retort but fell short. Did Speer have a point? Goldwater felt sweat building as he tried to respond. If Speer made this same point to the wider world, perhaps the other OFN nations would agree. Perhaps they were right to agree? Attempting to keep his cool, Goldwater began to consider conceding Speer's point. Or perhaps, to prevent further unfortunate lines of questioning, he should end the session here."

What I would instead propose is that you leave your allied nations out of it. The rest of your Organization of Free Nations should be permitted to trade with Germany if they so wish."\n\nAs Speer's translator finished relaying his words, Goldwater immediately scowled. "Is this why you brought me here today? So that you could propose sidestepping my authority and slipping into the western markets through the backdoor?" He leaned forwards before Speer had a chance to speak up. "Listen to me, Mr. Speer. I vowed to my people that I would shut fascism out of the Organization of Free Nations. I must emphasise - Free nations, Mr. Speer. As long as your people continue to goosestep their way into the darkness, I will uphold that vow."\n\nSpeer stuttered as he tried to respond. "I have done much to bring Germany into modernity! Even a man like you must see that-"\n\nGoldwater stood, a dark look taking his face. "A man like me? And what do you mean by that? Do you insult me as an American? Or perhaps you refer to the fact that my father was a Jew? Does that make you uncomfortable, Mr. Speer?" As the Führer stumbled for words, the President scoffed. "I can't believe I agreed to come here. You are no different to your beloved Hitler. Good day, Mr. Speer." With nary another word, he turned and stormed bitterly from the room."
 GLD.Speer.12.a:0 "What nonsense. We're done here."


 GLD.Speer.13.t:0 "The Unlikeliest Deal"
 GLD.Speer.13.desc:0 "Goldwater had expected to come to Geneva to show Speer who was boss. Instead, they were now making a deal.\n\nSpeer, somehow, had convinced him. While the specifics of the agreement would still need to be formally ratified, the embargo would soon be significantly loosened and trade would flow once again between the OFN and the Unity-Pakt. Goldwater wondered how exactly congress and the voters would respond to this development, and even as they began to depart he wondered if it was too late to back out.\n\nAs the President and the Führer stood in the hotel foyer, Speer turned to Goldwater and offered a handshake for the second and final time. "This was a productive meeting, Mr. Goldwater. I look forward to future dialogue with the United States".\n\nGoldwater paused as he returned the handshake. Shaking hands with a man whose country would consider someone of Jewish blood like himself as less than human still felt troubling. "This was more... diplomatic than I was expecting. Thank you for your time". With that, the two men departed the hotel for their respective return trips.\n\nGoldwater had a lot of time to think as his flight made its journey back to America. What would he say to the press? How would the party respond to his unexpected u-turn? What was his own take away from all of this? This had certainly not been the trip he had anticipated, and he was unsure if he would ever feel completely at ease about it. It was all making his head spin. Whatever else happened, he dearly hoped that this would be the only time he would ever meet Albert Speer."

He had come to Geneva with the most bold, longshot diplomatic overture Germany had made in a hundred years and come out on top. Goldwater had agreed to loosen the embargo and German business would surely breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nFor years, Germany had asserted its might through military dominance, yet Speer had now proved that they could also stand up in a war of words. That Goldwater, a man who had taken power on a platform of anti-fascist opposition and anti-German sentiment, had been convinced of the error of his ways was a great victory for the Reich - and for world trade as a whole.\n\nAs he returned to Germania, he was first greeted by Schmidt. "An excellent display, my Führer!" said Schmidt as he pushed a copy of the morning paper into his hands. The headline celebrated Germany's diplomatic coup, hailing Speer's overpowering of the USA's decision. It was a little embellished, as all German media tended to be, but Speer supposed it would do.\n\nAs he returned to his duties as Führer, Speer felt satisfied that he had proven his worth and demonstrated his new path for Germany. The time for tanks charging across Europe was over; now was the time for the Reich to take its place on the world stage as a true diplomatic player."

Goldwater had had enough and the world's press was already awash with the images of him storming angrily from the hotel, Speer himself emerging regretfully a while afterwards. He was not terribly surprised - the talks had been a long-shot after all - but he was disappointed all the same.\n\nThe condolences from Schmidt and the assertion by the German press that the failure was entirely the fault of the unreasonable and arrogant Americans did little to sooth his gloominess as he arrived back in Germania. The ceaseless messages from the major conglomerates lamenting their lost foreign assets left him gloomier still. He had failed. A man in his position could not afford failure. Weakness in the face of the tasks that still lay ahead for Germany was unacceptable.\n\nSitting at his desk, he considered where Germany might go from here. A relief package to dampen the woes of affected businesses was a given. A meeting with the economic bigwigs to determine alternate trade partners would also be essential. Yet no matter what, this failure would hang over his head for a long time. Securing free trade with the west had been one of his greatest diplomatic achievements. Now he had lost that and lost face all at once. It seemed that America and Germany were destined to be enemies."

The images of Goldwater emerging moments later showed a face tinged with equal parts irritation and smugness. That was exactly how he felt as he flew home over the Atlantic. It was a wasted journey, but at least he had made Speer look like a fool.\n\nWhen Goldwater arrived back in America, he found himself quickly swept before the journalists, all eager to hear his account of things. He smiled for the cameras, and waited for the hubbub to die down before speaking.\n\n"Mr. Speer is no different to his predecessor, nor any of those who tried to claim Germany in the past. He believes that his country deserves all the bounty of the free world without being a part of that free world. I tried to be reasonable, and I decided to hear him out in the interests of international diplomacy. Unfortunately, it is clear that even under its new ruler, the ego of the German nation knows no bounds.\n\n"Let this be a lesson to all those who rule with an iron fist. If you are willing to extend liberty, then liberty will extend its bounty unto you. If not, then the bounty shall forever be denied."\n\nGoldwater allowed himself a smile as he returned to the White House. He had kept his promise to the American people, shown up the forces of fascism, and demonstrated once and for all that America would always stand tall in the face of tyranny. It would surely be a great precedent for the future of the world - and for the future of his election prospects."

Even in a state like New York, no place had room for a handicapped minority man. He worked odd jobs for years, barely scraping by with the help of the NPP's generous welfare programs. While he didn't care much for politics, his interest peaked at a president which promised economic prosperity for all.\n\nBut that was then. No more food stamps, they say, it's a waste of money. We need to slash welfare; we could be using that for the environment, experts claim. Austerity, designed to bring economic prosperity for all and reduce the national debt, has simply taken it from the people who needed it most. Robert sighed, cold in his own home.
