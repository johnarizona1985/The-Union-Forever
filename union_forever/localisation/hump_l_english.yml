POLITICS_HUMP_DESC:0 "Born the son of a Norwegian Immigrant in the room above his father’s pharmacy in rural South Dakota, Hubert H. Humphrey cannot be said that he was born into great or even moderate privilege, working several jobs throughout his youth during the depths of the first depression before traveling south to attend Louisiana State University. \n\nLosing his first campaign for mayor of Minneapolis by a silm margin in 1943, Humphrey became associated with the Farmer-Labor Party, an alliance between rural and urban organizations that had formed during the depths of the Depression. Running again in 1945, he would break the Local Machine’s hold on the City and help make the FLP the strongest force in Minnesota politics, working alongside progressives and socialists to stitch together powerful coalitions.  Dedicated to Civil Rights, his famous speech at the 1948 Democratic Convention aggravated internal divisions even as the party was falling apart over the lost war and when the Civil Rights plank was rejected, he would defect to Henry Wallace’s National Progressives along with the rest of the FLP. \n\nFrom the election of 1948 onward, Hubert Humphrey has dedicated his career to the causes he holds dear; from dealing with rural and urban poverty, pushing for Civil Rights and above all else expanding and strengthening the American Labor Movement. Closely allied to Labor Unions, particularly A. Philip Randolph and Walter Reuther of the CIO, Humphrey has advocated endlessly for American Workers alongside the poor and the Farmers. \n\nHelping to grow the National Progressives into a nationwide force, negotiating with other labor, farmer, populist and even some socialist parties across the country, he kept the NPF together during the controversial merger with the right-wing Patriot Party into the NPP during the Eisenhower years and the hegemony of the Republican-Democrats. \n\nConsolidating his hold over the Centre with the help of Unions and Activists by 1968, he would storm to victory in the NPP Primaries over the hellish resistance of the Far Right’s Old Guard. Capturing the White House after a spirited campaign which saw him travel across the country giving rallies and speeches in favor of Unions, Civil Rights, Rural Relief and Public Projects, the “Happy Warrior of Minnesota” won over voters with his promises. America and the world now waits as to how Humphrey will wield the office of President on the domestic and international fronts, for the NPP is a fragile coalition and Humphrey’s practical idealism may be the cure or curse which might shatter the party or unite it."

 USA_Scoop_Jackson_dep_desc:0 "------------\n§LDespite being part of the NPP, Hubert Humphrey has long been known as being wary of direct intervention into Foreign Conflicts, preferring to a more hands off doctrine of training and material support. This tendency along with his few positive relationships with corporate America due to his closeness with organized labor made many within the more moderate, hawkish wing of the Centre tenuous in their support, leading to the selection of Senator Henry "Scoop" Jackson as the Vice Presidential nominee. Know for his close ties to several corporations, particularly the military contractor of Boeing, Jackson is more moderate in his economic stances and deeply Hawkish on Foreign Policy. His selection as Vice President, alongside his closeness to moderate elements within the NPP-FR headed by Senator Chase-Smith; might suggest a pivot towards consolidating the party within the Humphrey Administration or alternatively see Jackson rendered impotent and isolated as a political force.§!"

 USA_Victor_Reuther_pol_desc:0 "------------\n§LWhen talking about the politics of American Labor Unions, it is impossible to avoid the three Reuther Brothers who turned the United Auto Workers into the behemoth of Detroit. The eldest brother Walter might be the best known face and voice of progressive unionism in the country, constantly going across the country attempting to organize unions within the CIO's influence but for years his younger brother Victory has looked beyond America's borders. After traveling to Bukharin's USSR in 1927 alongside Walter to teach Russian workers in automobile factories, Reuther disliked what he saw as inefficiencies within the Soviet system but nonetheless felt deep sympathies with the Soviet workers. This experience led Victor to become deeply invested in the concept of international unionism, organizing workers in Canada during the post-war period as well as traveling across Central and South America. When Castro in Cuba began to do large scale land reform, it was Victor and Walter who went to Havana to meet with him and serve as a informal line of communication between Castro and Vice President Kennedy, helping to deescalate tensions. Now raised to the position of Secretary of State, Victor plans to use his position to strengthen labor unions across the OFN and the world.§!"

 USA_Rexford_Tugwell_eco_desc:0 "------------\n§LOne of the earliest leaders of the National Progressive Front alongside Henry Wallace and Norman Thomas themselves, Rexford Tugwell has long been a prominent and controversial intellectual within economic circles in America. Studying Agricultural Economics and Industrial Planning, he allied himself with the various Farmer and Labor Parties that sprung up across the midwest and plains during the Great Depression, advocating for government intervention and community ownership of banks, land and grain silos. Decried as a closet Red, Tugwell's ideas around price controls were nonetheless adopted by the Kennedy Sr. Administration to blunt his more radical appeals to farmers. For years, Tugwell has held influence over first the NPF and then the Centre's economic policy, now finally appointed as the Secretary of the Treasury within Humphrey's administration. While his more radical ideas of large scale planning have been deeply limited by the Administration, Tugwell nonetheless plans on launching large scale programs around public housing and support for agricultural co-ops.§!"

 USA_Sid_McMath_mil_desc:0 "------------\n§LMany things have been written and said about the long and impressive career of former Marine Officer Sid McMath, during the War while serving in the Pacific Theater, he rose through the ranks to become a Lieutenant Colonel fighting in several amphibious assaults and being decorated with the Silver Star and Legion of Merit. Following a bout of tropical sickness, he was moved to the logistical and planning offices of the Navy where he would gain experience with the office politics of the military, helping to organize landings and supplies for the chaotic rearguard actions in England which bred in him a deep resentment of the Germans alongside the Japanese. Following the Akagi Accords and the end of the war, McMath left the military to return home to his native Arkansas, soon seeking local office during the political chaos of the late 1940s, where his war record, anti-corruption and economic populism won him the support of several minor parties who would eventually make up the NPP, raising him to governor as the Democratic Party collapsed. His early dedication to Civil Rights alongside challenges from entrenched interests across the state saw him soon lose to Orval Faubus in the early 1950s, seeing him retire to Law.  With the election of Humphrey in 1968, McMath's experience as a bureaucrat as well as his long standing connections to the NPP-Centre made him a natural choice for some sort of position in the military.  Seen as a compromise candidate, with Vice President Jackson leaning towards the Far-Right's preferences and the left generally being wary of McMath's hawkishness, McMath in many ways embodies the disputes found within the Humphrey Administration's Foreign Policy. \n\nBut if the career of Secretary McMath is any indication; the conflicts, challenges and threats facing America during his tenure will be faced with the dogged determination of a Marine General, whatever may come from the official line he will serve his country with loyalty§!"

#Events
 USA.163.t:0 "Inauguration Day"
 USA.163.d:0 ""I, Hubert Horatio Humphrey Junior," the man from Minnesota with the scrunched face and receding hairline began with a confidence in his voice he hadn't felt since the Progressive National Convention of 1948. He smiled gently as the Chief Justice read to him the ensuing portions of the oath of office. The morning's papers spoke of his time as Mayor of Minneapolis, of his first term as Senator, his participation in the assemblage of the National Progressive Party, and as many other personal and political anecdotes as were fit to print. He moves his head gently away from the Chief Justice and towards the cameras, all on him. \n\nAbout two miles away from the press and the crowds and the applause, sitting idly in a basement meeting room of the Main State Building is a bespectacled man chewing on a pen, advisors filing in and out to stack papers on an oak desk. His brothers had promised to come by when the festivities were over, and maybe shed some light on things. The boss had given him a wide berth, and he intended to make use of it - anything would be better than how Nixon treated Rogers, he joked to himself. With a friend in every union and interest group from Newfoundland to Perth, he certainly had a big base to work with. His thoughts were cut off by an aide - "Victor, I have the Canadian Labour Congress on line one." \n\nA few blocks over, a man with a charming smile and graying hair looked out at the East Wing from a fourth story office in the Treasury Building. A 'commie', a 'traitor'. 'Rex the Red', they called him. And sure, he was a student of Sinclair, of Bellamy, of others who they'd call far worse names. And he had friends the same, in the maligned left wing of his party. And maybe he was the closest thing the Humphrey Cabinet had to one - he certainly had a plethora of ideas to save the country from the poverty and depression that afflicted it. He always had them, ever since avaricious capitalism rendered so many destitute in the 30s. But now he had the power to put them in place, because now they'd call him 'Secretary Tugwell'. \n\nBack on the raised platform by the Capitol Building, the man from Washington tried to match his superior's smile. He was far from a conservative - he shuddered at the thought - but in this company it surely felt like it. In the end, both him and Hubert were party men, there since the beginning. But as the culmination of a decades-long project stood atop it's greatest triumph, Scoop's mind wandered to the men who weren't there, the men who lost. Both within and without his party. No man ever ruled alone, and he intended to keep it that way. He glanced at his watch - he had meetings with Wallace and Johnson in a couple hours, and he hoped they needn't be rescheduled. \n\n"So help me god". said the man on the TV, as ten thousand desk jockeys and apparatchiks heard their starting pistol."
