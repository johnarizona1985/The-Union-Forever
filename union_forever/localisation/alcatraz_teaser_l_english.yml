 alcatraz_teaser.1.t:0 "Ash in the Wind"
 alcatraz_teaser.1.desc:0 "Located in the Mission District of San Francisco, situated between 16th and Valencia Streets, there once stood a symbol of hope for the American Indian people, taken from their reservations and forced to adapt the Urban Lifestyle that had become a staple of American Life. The American Indian Center had once provided a place of safety and sanctuary to thousands of those struggling to adapt to the American Way of Living; a place where those who were believed to be different and alien had found others similar to them; a place where every Indian no matter the age or gender had found belonging which they had not felt since they were relocated from their reservations. Life was harsh for the First Peoples that once settled this land thousands of years ago, but all memories of toil were simply brushed away as soon as one was welcomed into the AIC.\n\nOf all people, the American Indians knew by now that nothing good lasts forever. And that sentiment was confirmed during broad daylight on October 29th, 1969. A blaze had engulfed the entire Center in a ferocious inferno that melted everything the community had been built upon. Tears of many suffering souls had quenched the cinders; the remains of the fire that destroyed a community being swept into a silent death under the weight of overwhelming sorrow.\n\nRichard Oakes walked through the remains of a wooden door frame at a solemn pace. His facial muscles quivered, he tried his best to keep his composure as he wandered about the ravaged remains. His breathing became more and more sporadic with every passing step, and he could not stop his voice from breaking down into shaky speech as he comforted those who cried. Richard helped out a group of men who were trying to recover something below the rubble in desperation. Ash was in the air as the men cast aside pieces of burnt wood in a disorganized stack. The sun began to hide itself behind the veil below the horizon as the moon rose to replace it. Richard wiped his palms as he leaned back against a pile of charred wood.\n\n"You're a face I haven't seen around much, I hope this wasn't your first time here, was it?" asked a stranger in a rough Southern Accent.\n\n"Thankfully this wasn't my first time visiting." Richard responds in a depressed tone of speech. The stranger noded, then leaned closer to Richard.\n\n"Well, that's about expected. You've made quite a name for yourself. Perhaps one day you could start a community of your own like this one." Richard's frown fadeed like ashes being blown away by a slight breeze, and he chuckled.\n\n"That sounds like something I'd do, but us Indians have suffered too much recently. It feels a bit premature, wouldn't you agree?" Richard lifted himself up from the pile, patting down his ash covered shirt and pants.\n\n"You call it premature, but there's no better time to do something like that in my opinion. We've lost our place of sanctuary, the best move now would be to find a new one and protect it with all our will. We gotta stop acting like the White Man will take notice of our pain if we don't speak up." The stranger's sorrow charges his determination, his voice demonstrating that through an even tone. "One day, I hope that we will make the world understand our pain." Richard patted the stranger on the shoulder before wearily walking away from a hard day of labor and misery.\n\nAs the shining glare of the sun was replaced by the beaming reflection of the moon's shine. Richard Oakes sat on the front porch of his residence. Crickets chirped as he pondered what was to come for a people that were quietly dispersing into the realm of nothingness, like ash kicked up into the mighty blue skies from smoldering embers."

 alcatraz_teaser.2.desc:0 "They had come from across the United States. Peter Bowen had given them the boats for this gambit. They each downed some liquid courage for what was to come, and stepped aboard.\n\nIt was two hours after midnight. The Captains of those boats, like the freedom loving pirates of the age of discovery, sailed forth from Sausalito, lending their aid once again to those who struggled against uncaring governments. Quickly, and as quietly as they could do so, before the police could notice several Indians, equipped with sleeping bags, and all sorts of equipment needed for the stay on Alcatraz.\n\nFive boats. The eighty men and women stood shoulder to shoulder, gear stuffed onto the floor of these ships, barely fitting onto the boat themselves as they made their journey. Some were clinging to the rails for dear life, fearful of falling off into the water, as black as the night sky above them.\n\nThey had prepared for this day, from the Sausalito sailors to the women and men ready for the occupation. They could taste the sea salt on the wind as boats cut through the bay. A single light bulb lit the way for them all in a sea of black. The waves swelled, and the rain battered down upon them.\n\nIt seemed to take ages to sail the five miles; more than once the lightbulb that dangled in the front made as if to break away entirely. By miracle or stubbornness however, they began to see a small light. Alcatraz.\n\nIt was here they would make history. It was here the Indian would make a stand, and end Termination.\n\nThe solitary groundskeeper had expected yet another uneventful day. Alcatraz Island was demilitarized per the demands of the Japanese, and too desolate to be of any worth to anybody; the United States Bureau of Land Management couldn't justify any more than bare minimum for the maintenance of such a small island. After all, there was nothing to do here but watch the ships come in and out of the bay. Previous guards had hated the isolation, but Clarence Stewart enjoyed the quiet.\n\nIt was pure happenstance that he was up so early and looked down on the docks through the gloaming. He gawked, rubbed his eyes to confirm â€“ one, two ... five ships, with dozens of people, many with bright war bonnets and several with large drums. They hauled bags upon bags with them, filled with camping equipment, food, and more. Out of one of the bags spilled a few gas masks, one fell into the inky waters, the others hastily grabbed and placed back inside. He knew what duty he had here, alone and faced with a war band eighty strong. He ran to the radio, and called on it, almost yelling out ..."

 alcatraz_teaser.3.desc:0 ""... today to discuss a 4 million pound airliner deal. Back to you, Van."\n\n"Thank you Judith. And now for our top story tonight: an operation involving officers of the San Francisco Police Department and Sheriff's Department, using boats from the SFPD Marine Unit, attempted to land on Alcatraz Island and arrest the Indian occupiers. Our news team was alerted to the attempt and we went down to observe. This is what we saw."\n\nThe screen cuts to Van Amburg standing on the wind-swept wharf in Sausolito with a microphone, the early morning sun glittering off the San Francisco Bay. The camera zooms in on Alcatraz Island, bathed in pale yellow smoke. Seven boats are making their way to the wharf from the island.\n\n"As you can see, the police attempted to force a landing on Alcatraz, utilizing an enormous amount of tear gas. However, it appears that the gas has had miminal impact on the occupiers, as they were able to repulse the police. The only way onto the island is a tiny dock, everything else is sheer twenty foot tall cliffs, and the occupiers have a commanding view of the bay. From what we can tell, they used large rocks and other projectiles to prevent the police from reaching the dock."\n\nThe screen cuts back to the studio. After a moment Van continues to read from the teleprompter.\n\n"Later today Richard Oakes, spokesman for the occupiers, issued a statement on behalf of the organization which calls itself the Indians of All Tribes. In part he stated that the occupiers are non-violent and seek only a peaceful return of land given to them in treaties signed by the US government. He also thanked the Oakland branch of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense for providing them with gas masks and other defensive equipment and training. The Sheriff's Department and Police Department have rejected multiple requests for comment.""

 alcatraz_teaser.4.desc:0 ""That's barbaric!" Jackson's plodding, organized speech built to a low thunder "They're our people, shorn of their rights by the RDs! If we end Termination we can end this without any issues."\n\n"Without any issues, save the loss of every western industrial concern, every farmer putting Indian land to productive use, and every damn lump of Uranium the Navajo drag out of the earth you mean? How will you expand your precious arsenal then?" Russel Long drawled with a mocking twist.\n\nHumphrey only half-listened to the building argument. At the back of the Oval, Frank Church and Curtis Lemay whispered conspiratorially. Strange, their only shared interest was the CIA. Lemay swept out of the room, a touch quicker than usual.\n\nVernon Bellecourt, head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, stepped into the Oval. "Hello old friend! How's the family coping with this fetid swamp?" Vernon's troubled face curled into a wan smile "The weather's fine, it's the creatures you have to look out for."\n\nCronkite reappeared on the TV. "We now go live to a speech being made by Richard Oakes."\n\n"We have repulsed the attack by white-skinned savages with the help of Praying Whites, who have forsaken their heathen ways for the true gods and spirits of this land. We are happy to tutor all who ask in the ways of the true religion and true civilization of this land. However, future savage raids will be met with deadly force and the annexation of Angel Island as a buffer zone."\n\n"He hasn't the manpower to do that." Jackson scoffed, but then turned thoughtful. "Though ... he could shut down the port and Golden Gate if he has some rifle grenades, there's millions of those floating around since the Invasion Scare."\n\n"Well then, all we have to do is wait him out," replied Long. Jackson opened his mouth to restart his argument, but he didn't get the chance.\n\n"Or we could simply follow the law." Bellecourt interrupted. "The United States has made many treaties with the Indian Nations, each has the standing of law. It's time they were enforced." The rest stared. Humphrey smiled. "Vernon, I agree we have to do more for your people, but a lot has changed in 80 years. We ...""

Humphrey nodded. \n\nLong returned to his practiced drawl "Well, I guess we'll find out in the papers boys." Lemay's sour face eloquently replied, "You goddamned well better not."\n\nThey filed out, Jackson's visage alternating between confused and profoundly insulted.\n\nFrank Church sighed, "The equipment's still there, isn't it?"\n\nLemay raised his voice slightly, in his disciplined version of ranting, frothing fury. "Of course it is. Goddamned idiot spooks. The CIA has listening equipment in the lighthouse on Alcatraz Island. It was supposed to come out before the accords. Mr. President, we have to get that equipment off now. We cannot risk it falling into enemy hands, or the treaty violation being exposed."\n\nChurch considered, and offered, "We can get the protesters food, water, and supplies in exchange for removing Federal property from the Island. It will strengthen our hand for any further negotiations."\n\nLeMay shook his head in frustration. "I recommend that we assault the island using the 1st Marines with the USCGC Hamilton and the USCGC Taney operating as fire support."\n\n"You think it'll be that hard?" asked Humphrey.\n\n"Yes sir, anything less and I cannot guarantee the assault will be successful before they discover the devices." An unusual warmth softened his voice. "Oakes chose his ground well. Whatever you do, you have to do it now.""
